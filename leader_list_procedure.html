      <h1>LEADER LIST PROCEDURE</h1>
<div align="center">
  <table width="700" cellspacing="1">
    <tr>
          <td><h2>Hike Leadership - Obligation or Oppertunity?</h2>
            <p>Actually, leading a hike is both an obligation and an opportunity. If the group is going to hike every Wednesday, someone has to take on the responsibility for choosing and leading the hike. This involves providing directions to the trailhead, a description of the hike, and getting it scheduled. Establishing new hikes is definitely encouraged, but there are also many hikes, already documented on the web site that can be chosen (see <a href="https://www.otphiker.com/description.html">Descriptions</a>). The leader is also encouraged to check out the hike before-hand by walking parts of it to make sure there are no road or gate closures or other “surprises” that would preclude doing the hike. It goes without saying (so I’ll say it) the leader must lead the hike (not necessarily in front but at least monitoring the radio), and then waiting at the hike end for the last person to come in. Finally, as a courtesy, the leader should provide snacks for all present. </p>
			  
			  <h2>Advent of the Leader List</h2>
            <p>Soon after the group started hiking, it became obvious that  some fair method of rotating leadership amongst the active hikers was needed.  To be fair, this method must properly account for the participation of each  hiker on each hike, as well as the number of hikers coming out for each hike  week after week so that the<strong> intervals</strong> between leadership opportunities  becomes <strong>relatively equal</strong> for each leader. In the early days, Mike  Gessner used his method which mostly achieved reasonable interval spacing.  After he retired from running the hike operations, Ron Forbess took over the  task and immediately created a spread sheet, whose analog on the web site is  the Leader List. Ron employed a method using a point system updated  after each hike and documented on the <a href="https://www.otphiker.com/leader.html">Leader List</a>.<br>
              <br>
              
              I suggest at this point that you go to the OTP web site,  click on <a href="https://www.otphiker.com/leader.html">Leader</a> link at the top and explore the list. Note the columns  represent recent hikes, their corresponding dates and hike numbers. This window  shifts to the right as time goes by. The rows represent all hikers, active and  inactive, and the numbers along the rows represent their hiking activity on  those dates. The most important row for this discussion is the <strong>No. of OTP  Hikers</strong> which details the number of hikers that hiked that day. The most  important column is the last one on the right which represents the status of a  hiker&rsquo;s participation relative to the participation of all the other hikers.  Call this the &ldquo;reckoning column&rdquo; (see below).<br>
              <br>
              Paraphrasing what is stated in the legend on the web site  Leader List page:              </p>
            
              <p>
              The leader list gives your progress towards leading a hike.  Every time you attend a hike you receive one point. When you lead a hike, you  lose points based on the 6-month rolling average of the hike attendance. In  this way, everyone rotates hike leadership opportunities based on the frequency  of their hike attendance and a number that approximates the number of  hikers led on the hike.</p>
              <p>So, the time interval between your leadership opportunities  will be a function of how often you hike, and the number of people coming out  week after week to hike. </p>
              <h2>The Top Five</h2>
            <p>Each week, top-down sorts are made of all the Active hiker  rows and all of the Inactive hiker rows - based on the number in the last  reckoning column. In this way, those hikers with the higher numbers move  upwards with respect to the other hikers in each of these groups. Those five  active hikers with the five largest numbers automatically become the Top Five,  and it is now their obligation to choose a hike and have it scheduled.</p>
<h2>Rolling Average</h2>
            <p>If only 10 hikers came out to hike each and every week  without fail, then the fairest way would be to simply rotate the leadership  role between the ten hikers resulting in the period between led hikes of 10  weeks for each hiker. Such is not the case however. Scanning the current <strong>No.  of OTP Hikers</strong>, we find a variation of almost 2:1 (22/12). This is  quite good and indicates good numbers of hikers coming out each week. However,  greater numbers (4:1 or greater) have been observed in the past, probably due  to the number of hikers available (vacations), and preferences such as people  who don&rsquo;t hike in the summer or winter because it is too hot or too cold. By  using this number to reset the hike leader&rsquo;s points, its variability will  directly affect the interval between leadership opportunities causing the  intervals to also vary by this ratio. What is needed is some sort of an average  number of hikers from week to week that is also sensitive to long term seasonal  variations due to vacations and preferences.</p>
            <p>Figure 1 shows the rolling  average for a 26-hike window (26 weeks). After each Wednesday&rsquo;s hike, the  number of hikers in attendance for that day is averaged with the number of  hikers attending each hike that occurred during the previous 25 hikes.
</p>
			  <p><img src="images/Rolling_Average.jpg" alt="" style="width:95%;"></p>
			  <p>Figure 1.  Rolling Average Attendance Since Post-COVID Reunification</p>
<p>It was found that a 6-month (26 weeks) rolling average works  best for our group. The average number obtained each week is then used to reset  that leader&rsquo;s point score (see later). The process is repeated after the next  Wednesday&rsquo;s hike, and so forth, with the 26-week averaging window rolling along  1 week at a time.</p>
			  <h2>Leader Rotation</h2>			  <p>Returning to the Leader List, you can see the points building up for a given hiker followed by a sudden reduction in the previous value. This indicates that that hiker just led a hike. The resulting number is the difference between the point accumulation the week before the hike and the reset number determined from the Rolling Average. As the hiker continues to hike in the weeks following, the points again begin to accumulate starting from the number remaining after the reset, progressing ultimately to the Top Five, and leadership rotation based on personal attendance and overall attendance, as fair a method as we can create.
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    Some examples (see <a href="https://www.otphiker.com/leader.html">Leader List</a>): <br>
			    <br>
			    The current rolling average number appears to be 17 over most of the June through September time frame shown on the Leader List.
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    Ralph Shoukry had accumulated 14 points as of 7/5/2023. On 7/12/2023, after leading his hike and gaining 1 extra point for a total of 15 points. After subtracting the rolling average of 17 his score becomes -2. As Ralph continues to hike, he starts to accumulate points, but now starting from -2.
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    Amy Tsai had accumulated 16 points as of 7/12/2023. On 7/26/2023, after leading her hike she gains an extra 1 point for a total of 17 points.&nbsp; After subtracting the rolling average of 17, her score becomes zero. </p>
