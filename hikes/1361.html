<p><strong>THE HIKES:</strong>&nbsp; The principal hike is a 5.3-mile loop, up and over a near &ldquo;razor back&rdquo; ridge.&nbsp; The  high point of the hike is at 3 miles.&nbsp; There  are many opportunities to add to this distance by exploring many of the side  trails or inner loops.&nbsp; It is advisable to refer to the map before the hike to  see these loops.&nbsp; The hike is beautiful  (Creek Trail) and strenuous.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>DIRECTIONS  TO TRAILHEAD:</strong>&nbsp; North out of the San Fernando Valley on the I-5,  transition to the 14 toward Palmdale/Lancaster.&nbsp; Exit the 14 at the first off-ramp, Newhall Avenue.&nbsp; Turn right at bottom of the off-ramp and drive to the  lower parking lot.&nbsp; There are no parking fees, toilets, benches or picnic  tables.&nbsp; For relief or that last cup of coffee, exit the I-5 at Roxford for a  McDonald's or a gas station.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>THE  STRENUOUS HIKE:</strong>&nbsp; Note:  There are two trail heads (refer to the map).&nbsp; After passing the &quot;Elsmere Canyon Open Space&quot; sign on your right, take the right hand trail.&nbsp; Stay  right at the next junction (in about 1 mile, at the north end of the Elsmere Canyon Inner Loop).&nbsp; At the next junction (at about 2 miles, Remsen Road trail ) go straight.&nbsp; The trail is now running parallel to Hwy 14.&nbsp; Follow the road all the way to the ridge, about 2.8  miles.&nbsp; Follow the road up,&nbsp;over and down the east side until about mile 3.2, then go left, (south end of inner Elsmere Canyon Loop).&nbsp; At mile 3.7 take the right fork, and follow the trail to the canyon bottom, go  left on the Creek Trail (at mile 4.4), back to the trailhead (approximately 5.3 miles RT).&nbsp; For additional options and mileage, consult the map.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>THE  BEAUTIFUL HIKE:</strong>&nbsp; At the trailhead, go straight on the Creek Trail for a beautiful shaded walk along the creek with several crossings.&nbsp; At the junction, about 1 mile, go right.&nbsp; At about 1.5 miles, go left and stay left.&nbsp; Continue up to  the ridge. Retrace your steps to the trailhead, for about a 5.0-mile RT hike.&nbsp; Or, go as far as you  want and return.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>THE BEAST</strong>:&nbsp; A third  possible hike is to take the &ldquo;Beast&rdquo; trail to Placerita Canyon.&nbsp; This trail is  difficult, unmaintained and 6.1 miles one way.&nbsp; It justifiably earned its trail name. &nbsp; Allow 5 hours to complete.</p>
Refreshments will be served in the picnic area  at Placerita Canyon.&nbsp; Directions: Exit parking lot, go east 1 mile on Hwy 14, exit Placerita Canyon, and follow the road about 3 miles to Placerita  Canyon Park with full facilities including a small museum.

  <strong>A Note of  Interest:</strong>&nbsp; Not far from the hike location is a historical site called Beale&rsquo;s  Cut.&nbsp; The &ldquo;cut&rdquo; is a narrow passage  through the mountains over Newhall Pass.&nbsp;  It is so named for General Edward F Beale who carved it out of the  mountain. The cut was just wide enough to get a wagon through.&nbsp; Prior to this, Henry Clay Riley developed a  windlass to lower the wagons over the mountain for a fee.&nbsp; The Santa Clarita History Society describes Beale's Cut at <a href="http://www.elsmerecanyon.com/tunnelarea/passes/bealecut/bealecut.htm">www.elsmerecanyon.com/tunnelarea/passes/bealecut/bealecut.htm</a>.&nbsp; The cut is not too far from Elsmere Canyon should you have enough time and curiosity.</p>
