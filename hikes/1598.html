<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>&nbsp;From the 210 Freeway take the  Angeles Crest Highway 2 exit north a few miles to a large turnout on the right  just below mile marker 26.47. &nbsp;No pass is needed to park here. &nbsp;There  is no restroom at the trailhead, but Gould Mesa Campground has tables and  restrooms one mile into the hike.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:</strong> Proceed down paved Gould Mesa Road past the Gould Substaion.  &nbsp;The road, steep and slippery in places, becomes dirt and reaches Gould  Mesa Campground and the Gabrielino Trail in one mile. &nbsp;Turn left and hike  upstream 1.0 miles to the Paul Little picnic area (good place for a  cookie break). Continue upstream for a quarter mile to the Brown Mountain Dam  with its waterfall and pool. &nbsp;Return the same way. There are 16 stream crossings on the round trip, therefore two hiking sticks are recommended for those of us balance-challenged.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
Those desiring  more mileage can continue up over the dam on the Gabrielino Trail for as far as  they want.</p>
<p>Since there are no tables at the trailhead, an option would be to have lunch at the Gould Mesa Campground and then trudge up the steep road  to the cars together. Otherwise bring chairs for tailgate refreshments.</p>
<p>Distance:: 5.5 miles RT<br>
