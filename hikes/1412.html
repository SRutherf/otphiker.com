<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> From the 210 Freeway go north on Route 39 about 11 1/2 miles above  Azusa to mileage paddle 26.96.&nbsp; Park in the West Fork parking area on the  left.&nbsp; An Adventure pass or Golden Age pass will be required for parking.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp; </strong>About 7 miles from the trailhead is Glen Canyon camp. &nbsp;A  faint trail to the left will take you to Glen Canyon Falls. This is a triple  cascade falls and one the more spectacular when there has been a wet  year.&nbsp; The upper cascade is bit difficult to see.&nbsp; At the end  of&nbsp;&nbsp;the trail one must scramble up the bank on the right and peer  through the trees </p>
<p>Cogswell Dam is 8 miles from the trailhead, an easy trip if you  bring a bike or a bit strenuous if you hike. </p>
<p>You can make this outing as easy or as difficult as you wish.  &nbsp;The adventurers can take a side trip up Bear Canyon.&nbsp;&nbsp;One mile  up the West Fork is the trail to Bear Canyon. &nbsp;The Bear Canyon trail  involves a few water crossings so expect to get your shoes wet.&nbsp; There is a walk  in campground up the canyon, which is an excellent place to have lunch and  perhaps turn around.&nbsp; Nearby are the remains of an old cabin.&nbsp; Just some  stone walls left<br>
  . <br>
  The refreshments will be  available from about 1:30 to 3:00 PM.&nbsp; If you opt for a longer hike and  don't get back until after 3:00 PM; gee, that's tough.&nbsp; You'll also have  to square it with your ride pool. </p>
