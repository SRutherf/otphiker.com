<p>Hike #1298<br>
November 2, 2016<br>
Smith Mountain via Bear Creek Trail</p>

<p>Dorothy Ferrington, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
To the Saddle: 6 mi. RT, elevation gain = 1145 ft.<br>
Saddle to Peak: 0.6 mi. one way, elevation gain = 840 ft.<br>
Total to Peak: 7.2 mi. RT; elevation gain = 1985 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Drive up Hwy 39 from Azusa, 17 miles, to the beginning of the Bear Creek trail, marked by a metal sign; 1/4 mile before Coldbrook Camp (Paddle 32.12).  Park on the left side of the road.</p>

<p>The Hike: Walk 3 miles up the well graded Bear Creek trail to Smith Saddle at the top of the ridge.  Those with lots of energy can do an optional 1/2 mile additional steep scramble directly up the ridge to the top of Smith Mountain following traces of a path beaten by climbers.  Watch your footing during the ridge descent.</p>

<p>Lunch at the saddle (or peak), then return to the trailhead for refreshments. Note that there are no places for seating - please bring chairs.</p>
