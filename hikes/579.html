<p><center><h3><b>#579</b></h3></center><br>
<center><h3><b>Buckhorn to Cooper Canyon Campground</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: Hike A = 5 miles; Hike B = 8 miles<br>
Altitude Gain: About 1650 ft. for both hikes.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: Drive the Angeles Crest Hwy. Buckhorn Campground at marker 58.02, almost 34 miles from La Canada.  Hopefully we can park at the north end of the road beyond the campground, if the gates are open.  We will shuttle longer hikers 4 miles further to Eagles Roost.</p>

<p>Hike A: From Buckhorn Campground, take Burkhart Trail to PCT/Cooper Canyon Trail.  Turn left (west) on PCT and walk to Cooper Canyon Campground for lunch and turn around.  Return by same route.</p>

<p>Hike B: From Eagles Roost, take Pacific Crest Trail to Cooper Canyon Campground.  Return to junction of PCT/Burkhart and turn right (south) on Burkhart Trail. Walk out to Buckhorn Camp ground.</p>

<p>Note 1: Cooper Canyon Falls is just 0.1 mile east on the PCT from its junction with the South Burkhart Trail.  There is a short steep footpath down to the creek.</p>

<p>Note 2: For each hike, you can reduce altitude gain by 500 feet by not going beyond Cooper Canyon Falls at the Burkhart/PCT junction.</p>

<p>Note 3: The Burkhart Trail slightly jogs as it crosses the PCT. Going south on the Burkhart Trail takes you to Buckhorn Campground.</p>
