<center><h3><b>Dawn Mine Loop (Sunset Ridge Fire Road)</b></h3></center></p>

<p>DISTANCE:  6 or 7 miles<br>
ELEVATION GAIN: About 1400 ft.</p>

<p>DIRECTIONS:  Exit the 210 Fwy. just east of Devils Gate Dam on Arroyo/Windsor Blvd.  Go left over the Fwy. and take the first right turn at Woodbury Rd.  After several blocks, turn left up Lincoln.  Go a mile or so and turn right on Loma Alta Rd. Turn left at the flashing yellow light at Chaney Trail, and take the narrow winding road to the summit where there is a small parking area.</p>

<p>THE HIKE: We will hike up the Sunset Ridge Fire Road to the foot trail on the left and follow that trail to the junction with The Sunset Trail (12W18).  We will take the Sunset Trail up to the old railroad bed, turn left and follow the roadbed to the kiosk at the Dawn Mine Trail Junction.  At this point, we have topped out at a 1400-foot gain.</p>

<p>We leave the roadbed and take the trail down to Dawn Mine. It is a steep, narrow and rugged but passable.  After lunch at Dawn Mine, we will proceed down the canyon watching carefully for the trail to the left, which is well worn and easy to spot.  We follow that trail back out to the Sunset Ridge Fire Road.</p>
