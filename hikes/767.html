<center><h3><b>Angel's Walk - Los Angeles (Southern Loop)</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 4 miles RT on pavement<br>
Elevation gain: 150 ft.

<p>Summary: The purpose of this hike is to introduce you to a few of the sights of our civic center. Another is to induce you to try public transportation, especially the MetroRail which is fast and economical. The basic route completes the Angel's Walk portion through the historic core of Los Angeles (see OTP Angel's Walk - Northern Loop - #651). Our path will generally go north from 7th Street, paralleling Hope Street, ending at the Wells Fargo complex at 4th and Grand.  We will return to the Red Line Pershing Square Metro station accessible at the north-west corner of 4th and Hill Streets where hikers can make their way home.</p>

<p>The plan is to split into small groups, each led by a person who is familiar with the route. To keep track of each group's progress, we will have designated assembly points where we will all join together for a headcount, toilets, etc. These are denoted below by brackets: [ ]. We will communicate by cell phone, and a list of numbers will be made available.</p>

<p>The intent is to make this more of a saunter rather than an all out hike.  Stop and check stuff out, in particular the Angel's Walk kiosks which are located near and give details on the places we will visit.  NOTE: The Pershing Square kiosk is located across from the square near the new Jewelry Center on the north-east corner of 6th and Hill.</p>

<p>Directions to trailhead: We will meet at the designated time at the 7th Street Metro Station, assembling near the corner of Flower and 7th.</p>

<p>The Hike:</p>

<p>1. Walk west along the north side of 7th toward Figueroa.  Between Flower and Figueroa, there is a bathroom at McDonalds if needed, then stop and examine the exterior and explore the lobby of the Fine Arts Bldg., the paintings and especially the ceiling.  Note the modern exterior of the Home Savings of America Tower as you continue west on 7th.  Cross Figueroa and then 7th - you are now on the south-west corner.</p>

<p>2. Continue south 100 feet and note a circular overview.  This is the Seventh Market Place which you are free to briefly explore.  When once again at street level, climb the stairway just to the north side of the market and continue on to circle the Citicorp Plaza, the gardens, the view south, and the "Corporate Head" statue as you come around the buildings on to 7th once again.  We now backtrack by marching east along the south side of 7th (check the exterior of the Fine Arts Bldg., now from across the street) until we cross Flower, where we turn left (north) and walk about 3 blocks almost to 5th.  We watch for the entrance to the [Maguire Gardens] adjacent to the LA Public Library on our right.  Here we will stop, snack and rest in the shade of the fountains and plantings until all groups are present.</p>

<p>3. Walk east into the library, go up to the second floor, and enter the rotunda with its chandelier representing the solar system, and the murals on the four walls depicting a romanticized vision of Los Angeles' past.  There are bathrooms on the first floor (ask at the info desk).  Exit onto the south side of 5th, turn right (east) and head toward and cross Grand Ave. Turn right (south) and proceed to 6th and turn left (east) continuing along the north side of 6th.  Stop at the Pacific Center and check out its Corinthian Temple entrance (look up at the two gods on top of the arch) and the Beaux-Arts lobby.</p>

<p>4. Continue east along the north side of 6th Street to Olive, turn right (south), cross 6th and continue a half block along the west side of Olive to the Art Deco Oviatt Bldg with its iron trimmings and marble lobby.  Turn around, go north back along 6th Street, cross 6th and Olive and enter Pershing Square.  We will gather together in the shade at the north end of the park, but take the opportunity to wander around the plantings, ponds, the purple campanile, and at the intersection of 6th and Hill Streets, the jewelry district.  We will use [Pershing Square] to gather all groups again.</p>

<p>5. Departing from Pershing Square, cross Olive and enter the Biltmore Hotel entrance.  This is the famous lower lobby seen often in photographs and movies.  There are bathrooms at the back of this lobby to the right of the right hand stair case.  Take the stairs to the upper lobby, and continue along this to check out the Crystal Ballroom, photos of previous Oscar celebrations, etc.  For those without lunch. exit the hotel onto Grand Ave. turn right (north) and proceed up to 5th Street.  Cross over to the north-west corner of Grand and 5th - at which point there is a La Salsa Mexican restaurant as well as sidewalk cafes running along 5th.  For those who brought their lunch, exit the Biltmore and return to Pershing Square.  At an agreed upon time, we shall all gather at the north-west corner of Grand and 5th.</p>
<p>6. We continue west on the north side of 5th past the Library Tower - the tallest building in LA (look in the windows at the mural on the lobby wall celebrating the naming of the Los Angeles river) to the Bunker Hill Steps (there is an escalator on the left side of the stairs as well as the Les Petite sandwich shop mid-way up).  At the top of the stairs, walk toward 4th and check out the various sculptures, on both sides of Hope as well as below on 4th.  While you're at it, note the ramp that allows you to walk downhill on 4th, which will be the way home to the Pershing Square Metro station.</p>

<p>7. Cross Hope, and continue west past the YMCA, and onto a bridge over Flower and enter the Bonaventure Hotel.  We are at level 6 at this point, and we must return to this point to continue the hike.  The plan is to descend down into the hotel and explore the various lobbies, etc.  Allow ten minutes for this, then return to the hotel's 6th level exit and walk east back to the south-west corner of the intersection of 4th and Hope, at which point we turn left (north), cross 4th, and explore the gardens and the view adjacent to the Bank of America Tower (formerly ARCO).  Note also the [Calder sculpture] - the large red arches in front of the building. We will meet near the arches to gather all groups again.</p>

<p>8. Exiting the gardens, go east and cross Hope Street at the mid-block traffic light and enter the lobby of the Wells Fargo Center.  Here we have a pleasant multi-level expanse with fountains, sculptures, water, places to rest, etc.  There are two sculptures outside, the "Night Sail" on the south side of the building, and a whimsical assemblage "Sequi" on the north side on the walk to the Wells Fargo Museum (at the north end of the complex).  At this point the hike ends.  Hikers may visit the museum, or else make their way back to the south-east corner of 4th and Hope and to the 4th street ramp noted above and proceed east down 4th (crossing to the north side when convenient) to Hill Street.  Just before reaching Hill Street, look left to see the Pershing Square Metro terminal entrance just off the north-west corner*.</p>

<p>At this station, only the Red Line is available.  There are two Red Line trains, one going to west Wishire, and one to the Valley. Valley types will obviously take the  train going away from Union Station and going to North Hollywood.  South Bay types will take either Red Line train away from Union Station to the 7th Street station, then transfer to the Blue Line trains.</p>

<p>*A possible alternate route to the Pershing Square Metro station would be to exit the Wells Fargo Center plaza to the east, crossing Grand and entering the water court at the California Plaza.  Continue east across Olive, and down the steps at Angel's Flight to Hill then turn right (south) a half block to the Red Line metro station entrance at 4th.</p>
