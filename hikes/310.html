  <p>DISTANCE:&nbsp; 5 to 6 miles round  trip to Sunset Peak, + optional 3 more miles round trip out Sunset Ridge.</p>
  <p>ALTITUDE GAIN: 1,273 feet,  4,523-5,796</p>
  <p>FEATURES:&nbsp; The hike winds up a  fire road to the summit.&nbsp; Hopefully, a  clear day will give us a great view.</p>
  <p>THE HIKE:&nbsp; Exit the 210  Freeway at Mountain Avenue in the Claremont/Upland area.&nbsp; Head north on Mountain Avenue.&nbsp; In a mile or two, Mountain Avenue will swing  off to the East to get around San Antonio Dam, and then back west and north,  upstream of the dam.&nbsp; Soon, it will merge  with Mt. Baldy Road.&nbsp; (In bygone years,  when we came up Mills Avenue, we would merge with Mt. Baldy Road on the West  side of the dam).</p>
  <p>Proceed up Mt. Baldy Road on  through and past the tunnel.&nbsp; Take a  sharp left at Glendora Ridge Road.&nbsp; Park  on the right, a mile up the road, at Cow Saddle.&nbsp; The trailhead is across the road.</p>
Note:&nbsp; There were no rest rooms when we were last  there.&nbsp; The ranger station is up town on  the left.
