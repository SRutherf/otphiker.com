<strong>Basic Hike (5.6 miles RT,  1464 ft. elevation gain):&nbsp;</strong> Take the Fern Canyon Nature Trail to Fern Canyon Trail and  turn left up to 5 Points.&nbsp; Follow the sign to the Joe Klass water stop  with shade trees and tables.&nbsp; Turn right on paved Vista Del Valle Drive  and walk on the road for a short distance.&nbsp; Look for a green wooden pump  house on the left located at the junction of Riverside and Hogback  Trails.&nbsp; Bear right on the Hogback Trail steeply up the ridge to Dante&rsquo;s  View and Mt. Hollywood.&nbsp; Follow the North Trail keeping right at two  junctions (follow signs for Bee Rock) down to Vista Del Valle again.&nbsp; Turn  right and walk down the pavement a short distance past a water stop to the Bill  Eckert Trail.&nbsp; Follow this down to the Old Zoo area, past the Bee Rock  Trail to take the Upper Old Zoo Trail back to the parking lot.&nbsp; It may become a little confusing in the Old  Zoo area, but just head towards the Merry-Go-Round.&nbsp; <br>
