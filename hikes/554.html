<center><h3><b>Van Tassel Fire Road to Mt. Bliss</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 8.5 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain: 2600 ft.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions:  605 north or 210 freeway east to Mt. Olive exit. Go north to Huntington Drive and turn right (continue east).  Turn left (north) after 0.5 miles on Los Lomas Rd. Turn right (east) after 0.3 miles on Royal Oaks Dr. Turn left (north) after 0.5 miles on Mel Canyon. Go 0.4 miles to the top of Mel Canyon (dead-ends), turn around and park on west side of street opposite house at 204 Mel Canyon, above and alongside of Valley View School campus.</p>

<p>The Hike: We enter a "vacant lot" just north of the Valley View School, head north, and follow an old, nearly overgrown trail around a green water tank. After about 0.5 mile, we reach a little spur road. Turn left, and we quickly reach the Van Tassel Fire Road. Turn left again, and follow the fire road up. (Note this junction - it is easily missed on the way back).</p>

<p>We reach the ridge after 2.5 miles. Note the planted trees that line the road here and farther up. As we continue to climb, Mounts Wilson and Monrovia become visible along with the intervening canyons on either side of the ridge including the San Gabriel River outfall. If clear, the bulk of the San Gabriel Valley should be spread out before us with the Miller brewing plant and the gravel operations at Irwindale more than obvious.</p>

<p>At 4 miles, we turn right up a power-line spur road reaching a ridge where we scramble up under 3 power towers to reach the peak of Mount Bliss. Lunch at the peak of Mt. Bliss.
From the peak, we should get to look into Fish Canyon with Baldy, Pine and Dawson looming over it. Telescope, Telegraph, Ontario Peak to their right, and Baden-Powell, south Mt. Hawkins and Mt. Hawkins to the left. Swinging north, we can see Troop and Islip and Waterman, plus some of the peaks in the Mt. Wilson area. You can also look into the deep gravel pit and see the bottom of 3 tiers of excavation.</p>

<p>This is a strenuous hike on loose gravel in places, and with little shade. For those wanting to do a lesser hike, turn around at any point and return.</p>

<p>Return to trailhead via same route in reverse, BEING careful to turn right after coming down off the peak ridge to follow the spur road back to the Van Tassal, and finding the spur road off of the Van Tassel to get to the trail back to the cars.</p>

<p>Refreshments at the trailhead.</p>
