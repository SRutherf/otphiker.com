<p>The Hike: In the past we have hiked west and south.  This time we will hike north towards Bell canyon and west to make a counter clockwise loop.  We climb up in elevation and have beautiful views of the valley, Bell canyon and the surrounding mountains.</p>

<p>About half of the trail is not shown on maps but can be seen on Google Earth type displays.  There are many trails and one has to follow the right one to make the loop. A set of GPS waypoints is listed below for guidance for those with GPS devices. It is recommended that hikers follow those so equipped. 

<p>Refreshments will be at the trailhead.</p>
