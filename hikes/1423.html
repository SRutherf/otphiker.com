Trailhead  Directions:&nbsp;</strong> From the 405 Freeway take Hawthorne Boulevard South, up and  over &ldquo;The Hill&rdquo; to the end of Hawthorne Blvd. at Palos Verdes Drive West.&nbsp;  Turn left at the traffic light. (where you&rsquo;ll find a &ldquo;Starbucks&rdquo; for coffee).  Turn right at the next turn off, which will be the entrance to Point Vicente  Interpretive Center, and park in the parking lot.&nbsp; This small natural history museum is an ideal  whale-watching spot.&nbsp; Exhibits highlight the peninsula's geology, flora  and fauna.&nbsp; There are restrooms available  at the park, after 9 am and at Terranea Resort.<br>
  <br>
  If you take  the 110 Freeway, go South to the Pacific Coast Hwy off-ramp and head West.  &nbsp;Turn left when you come to Hawthorne Blvd. and follow the directions  listed above.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> This is a 4.7-mile loop with about 400 feet of elevation gain on trails around Rancho Palos  Verdes City Hall and continues down and around Terranea Resort. &nbsp;The hike starts on a trail adjacent to PV Drive  then crosses the two lanes of traffic where the northbound lane enters the  parking lot.&nbsp; There is no traffic light  here and the traffic moves fast so be very cautious.&nbsp; Continue on the trail along PV Drive 0.3 mile  until reaching a gated access road on the left.&nbsp;  Go up this to enter the <a href="../aerialphotomaps/Alta_Vicente_Reserve.pdf">Alta Vicente Reserve</a>.&nbsp; In the Reserve the route will be the Prickly  Pear Trail, the Alta Vicente Trail, the Nike Trail, the access roads of the  City Hall, the North Spur Trail and the Alta Vicente Trail.&nbsp; The route then continues on the Salvation  Army Trail to the traffic light where we cross PV Drive and go down Terranea  Way a short distance to the Flowerfield Trail.&nbsp;  Head down this trail to the Terranea Trail where we turn right and  continue to the Beach Trail.&nbsp; Go down to  see the cave and beach and come back to the Terranea Trail.&nbsp; Take this trail all the way around Terranea  Resort and back to PV Drive and then the trail next to the road to the  Interpretive Center.<br>
  <br>
  It is 3.3  miles if you skip the Terranea loop and return on the trail along PV Drive  after the traffic light.<br>
  <br>
  A short 2.5  mile scenic hike starts as above but in the Alta Vicente Reserve skip the Nike  Trail and continue on the Alta Vicente Trail to the paved access road.&nbsp; Walk down this road to PV Drive, turn right  and walk to the Traffic light.&nbsp; Cross PV  Drive and head down Via Vicente, which is the extension of Hawthorne Blvd.&nbsp; Turn left at Calle Viento then right at  Pacifica Del Mar then take the Terrace Trail at the dead end to the Bluff Trail.&nbsp; Turn left and head to the Interpretive  Center.</p>
There are many ways to extend the main  hike.&nbsp; The Tramonto Trail, the Vanderlip  Park Trail, the Toveemor Trail to the ocean and just explore around Terranea  Resort.
