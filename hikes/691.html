<center><h3><b>Backbone Extension - Ventura County</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 8.2 miles round trip<br> 
Elevation gain: 800 ft.</p>
 
<p>Direction to Trailhead: The trailhead is located approximately 3.8 miles from the intersection of Mulholland Highway & Little Sycamore Canyon Road.  From the Valley you can take Highway 23 south to Mulholland. Turn right at Mulholland & right again at Little Sycamore Canyon.  (For a less windy road, you can also take Malibu Canyon to PCH.  From PCH take Yerba Buena Road north near County Line.  The parking lot is marked by a sign that indicates VC 7.00 on the southwest side of the road.</p>

<p>The Hike: The new segment of the Backbone Trail features mostly upland vegetation.  There are a number of spectacular views toward the Pacific Ocean. This segment completes virtually all of the Backbone Trail within Ventura County.</p?

<p>We can have lunch on an outcropping of rocks just a short distance down the road from the end of the trail (turn right). Then we'll return to the parking lot for refreshments.  There are no bathroom facilities.
