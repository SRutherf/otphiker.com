  <strong>The Hike:&nbsp; </strong>The hike goes through Cobal Canyon and Burbank Canyon, with a five-mile loop on a fire  road, and many smaller peak-bagging trails. Bring plenty of water and a hat.  There have been various wild animal sightings in neighborhoods and in the CHWP,  including squirrels, lizards, rattle snakes, bears, deer, bobcats, coyotes, and  mountain lions. It is a wide  trail path, with a little shade on the &quot;east side&quot; of the initial  fork near the trailhead, and some occasional shade spots at the sides of the  mountain path. There are benches for resting in the shade every mile or so to  take in the fabulous views  of downtown LA, Catalina Island, and the San Gabriel&rsquo;s Front Range. The Park consists of a variety of native chaparral, with  large clusters of California Sycamores, Coast Live Oaks, Canyon Live Oaks, and  White Alders.<br>

  <strong>History:&nbsp;</strong> The earliest known inhabitants of the area were  the nomadic Serrano (highlander) Indians. The Claremont area became part of  Mission San Gabriel founded in 1771. The Native Americans who lived here at  that time became known as the &ldquo;Gabrielenos&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tongva.&rdquo; More than 100 years ago, Stephen Gale homesteaded land  near what is now Pomello Avenue. The land is part of Claremont's history as the  former site of the Gale Family Angora Goat Ranch, the only angora ranch in  Southern California which was in operation until the 1920's.<br>
