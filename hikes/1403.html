<p><strong>Trailhead Directions:</strong>&nbsp; From the 405 Freeway take Hawthorne Boulevard South, up and over “The Hill” to end of Hawthorne Blvd. at Palos Verdes Drive West.&nbsp; Turn left at the traffic light. (where you’ll find a “Starbucks” for coffee).  Turn right at the next turn off, which will be the entrance to Point Vicente Interpretive Center, and park in the parking lot.</p>

<p>If you take the 110 Freeway, go South to the Pacific Coast Hwy off-ramp and head West. &nbsp;Turn left when you come to Hawthorne Blvd. and follow the directions listed above.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> Our hike will begin at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center.&nbsp; Located next to Point Vicente Lighthouse, this small natural history museum is an ideal whale-watching spot.&nbsp; Exhibits highlight the peninsula's geology, flora and fauna.&nbsp; The hike will be a six and a half mile loop with minimal elevation gain.&nbsp; We will explore the area around and thru the Terranea Resort heading down to the shoreline and explore the coastal cliffs.&nbsp; If the weather cooperates, the shoreline and ocean views are magnificent.</p>
