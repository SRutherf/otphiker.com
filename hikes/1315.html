<p><strong>Hike #1315<br>
Rocky Peak via the Chumash Trail<br>
April 19, 2017</strong></p>

<p><strong>Roland Bassett, Hike Leader</strong></p>

<p>Distance: 8 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1500 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>Take the 118 west and exit on Yosemite (2nd exit after Rocky Peak). Go north ½ mile and turn right on Flanagan Drive. Go ¾ miles to the end and park on the street. There are no restrooms at the trailhead, but there is a gas station and a McDonalds as you get off the freeway on the left side of the road.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike: </strong>We start up the Chumash trail which intersects Rocky Peak Road at 2.7 miles. Turn right and continue south on the Rocky Peak Road. In about 0.6 mi bypass the signed intersection with the Johnson Motorway. Continue on Rocky Peak Road for another 0.75 mi then look for a use trail that leads off to the left over and around a small peak (West Peak) (<a href="../aerialphotomaps/RockyPeakDetail.jpg">See Detail of Rocky Peak Access Trail</a>). Only after getting around West Peak can Rocky Peak be seen. Continue on the trail down onto a saddle between the two peaks then proceed to scramble up the rocks to Rocky Peak. We return to the trailhead the way we came.</p>

<p><strong>Shorter Option:</strong> Turn around wherever you want!</p>

<p><b>Caution:</b> The "connector trail" shown in the photo connecting the Hummingbird Trailhead to the Chumash Trailhead resulted from a hike exploring a loop hike combining the two trails. Recent construction in this area may preclude hiking this path.</p>
