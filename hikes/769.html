<center><h3><b>Las Virginas Reserve (Ahmandson Ranch) from Victory Blvd.</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 5 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain: 500 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: For those in the Valley area, take Victory Blvd. westbound to the trailhead.<br>
For those traveling from the south, take the northbound Ventura (101) Fwy., exit Valley Circle Blvd. Turn right (north) and go approximately 2 miles to Victory Blvd.  Turn left and go approximately 1 mile to the trailhead. Parking fee is $3.00 per vehicle. Restroom facility consists of one Andy Gump.</p>


<p>The Hike: The good news - this is a fairly short hike with moderate altitude loss/gain. The bad news - the shade is minimal and the heat is hot. Take the East Las Virgenes Canyon trail (unmarked) in a westerly direction. At a junction after approximately ¼ mi., continue on the trail to the right. At approximately 1 mi. there is another junction. Take the left trail which will lead up to Laskey Mesa. Proceed on the Mary Wiesbrock loop trail around the mesa in an easterly direction until you reach a junction. Bear to the left (north). This trail continues to the first junction of the hike. Turn right to return to the trailhead.</p>
