<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
Crystal Lake to Windy Gap = 5.0 mi. RT; max. elev. = 1800 ft.<br>
Crystal Lake to Mt. Islip via Windy Gap (return by same route) = 7.8 mi. RT; max. elev. = 2530 ft.<br>
Crystal Lake to Mt. Islip via Windy Gap (return via Big Cienega trail) = 8.1 mi. RT; max. elev. = 2530 ft.<br>
Little Jimmy Loop = 0.9 mi. RT, max. elev. = -105 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to trailhead:</strong>&nbsp; On east I-210, exit Azusa Avenue (Highway 39).&nbsp; Go north through Azusa into San Gabriel Canyon.&nbsp; After 12 miles one passes the bridge to the East Fork Road.&nbsp; Continue straight on Highway 39 for 12 more miles.&nbsp; Turn right into the signed entrance to Crystal Lake Recreation Area.&nbsp; Drive through the campground.&nbsp; Go ½ mile past the Snack Shop and Visitor Center to where there is a locked gate in front of you and the road forks in several directions.&nbsp; Park in the large dirt lot on the right.  Rest rooms are scattered throughout the area.</p>

<p><strong>The hike:</strong>&nbsp; The trail starts across from the parking area.&nbsp; The trailhead is signed “Windy Gap - 2.5 mi.” Windy Gap is the low point in the ridge in front of you.&nbsp; In 0.04 mile you cross a road heading to Deer Flats and South Hawkins. &nbsp; Continue on the trail and in 0.07 mile more you will again cross the South Hawkins road and continue on the signed trail.&nbsp; In 0.1 mi. one reaches a junction with the Big Cienega Cutoff Trail. &nbsp; Continue right on the main trail. In about 2.3 miles you will reach Windy Gap Saddle where there is always a cooling breeze.</p>  

<p>At this point there are choices to be made.&nbsp; Call it a hike, and return to the trailhead the way you came.&nbsp; Continue on to Little Jimmy Campground or Mt. Islip or Mt. Hawkins.&nbsp; At Mt. Islip you may either return to Windy Gap, or continue beyond the peak on a marginal trail via Big Cienega, ultimately intersecting the Windy Gap trail at the South Hawkins road.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information added 4/17/2022</strong></p>
<p>The Hike #1491 description is changed  as follows: due to the Bobcat fire, the trail to Windy Gap is open.&nbsp;  However, the trail to Little Jimmy Campground is closed, so is the trail to Mt.  Hawkins.&nbsp; When you get to Windy Gap the only option is to continue on the  Mt. Islip Ridge Trail to Mt. Islip or turnaround and head back to the  trailhead.&nbsp; From Mt. Islip continue on&nbsp; the Mt. Islip Ridge Trail to  the Big Cienaga Trail back to the trailhead (reference: Islip, Windy Gap Map in  the hike description).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
