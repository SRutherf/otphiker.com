  <strong>Directions to Trailhead:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>From the valley: </strong>&nbsp; Take Topanga Canyon Road to PCH, and  then drive south to Sunset Blvd.&nbsp; Go east on Sunset for 0.3 miles (to the second  signal) and turn left on Los Liones Drive.&nbsp; Go north on Los Liones Drive for 0.3  miles and park in the first parking lot.&nbsp; If you pass the first parking lot, you  will come to a another parking lot 0.1 mile further up the road.&nbsp; You may park  in this lot if the first lot is full. If you reach the dead end of Los Liones  Drive, you have gone too far so turn around and drive back to the parking  lot.&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>From the south:</strong> Take PCH to Sunset Blvd. and follow  instructions above.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Hike: </strong>&nbsp; This hike climbs the Los Liones Trail for  1.5 miles and 530 feet of elevation gain to a ridge-top clearing that looks  down on Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica, and the ocean beyond.&nbsp; On a clear day,  the view extends to Palos Verdes and Catalina Island.&nbsp; Those who want a short  hike may turn around here for a 3 mile RT hike.<br>
  <br>
Those who want a longer hike can continue along the  Topanga fire road to the Parker Mesa Overlook, which is 3.5 miles from the  trailhead with a total of 1250 feet elevation gain.&nbsp; The view here is  spectacular, similar to the first one, but from a higher elevation.&nbsp; Those eager  for more exercise may continue along the Topanga fire road before returning to  the trailhead.</p>
<p>There are bathrooms and picnic tables at the  trailhead.&nbsp; Refreshments will be served there.</p>
