<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.&nbsp; This will avoid the inconvenience and save costs to the hike leader.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>Directions  to Trailhead: &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Go to the southern end of Harbor Fwy (110) to  Gaffey Street, San Pedro exit, South (left) on Gaffey to 9th Street West,  (right) on 9th Street to Western Avenue (1.4 mile).&nbsp; Cross Western and  turn left in half a block onto Friendship Park Drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
  Restrooms are  available inside the Nature Center, which opens at 9 AM.<br>
  <br>
  Many  hike variations are possible in this area, I have picked three. You should walk  on the left-hand side of the roads that do not have  sidewalks, so that you face the oncoming bicycle and automobile traffic. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  All of  the hikes start on the Fowler Trail through the Friendship Park and exit the  park on Calle Aventura.&nbsp; Elevation gains  are WAGs. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Short Hike (yellow  path, 5 mile loop, 500 ft gain):</strong>&nbsp; Go  North, walking on the right-hand side of Palos Verdes Drive East (PVDE) to the  Colinita Trail (A) which starts 20 yards past the &ldquo;Welcome to Miraleste&rdquo;  sign.&nbsp; Cross the street at the trail end  to proceed on the Siena Loop Trail (B).&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then cross Miraleste Drive to the Lorraine Trail (C) and go North to the  La Canada Trail (D), which ends at PVDE near the Miraleste Plaza.&nbsp; There is a picnic table in the plaza.&nbsp; Return to Friendship Park via PVDE or return  on the trails. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Intermediate Hike (green path, 6.5 mile loop, 900 ft  gain):&nbsp;</strong> Go South on PVDE, up the Crest  Road to the Nike Trail (F) and then continue up Crest to Paseo de Pino.&nbsp; The stairway on the right descends to the  Miraleste Canyon Trail (E), although walking down Paseo de Pino may be  preferred.&nbsp; Parts of the trail have been  washed out by our recent rain storms.&nbsp; Be very careful crossing PVDE at the  end of the Miraleste Canyon Trail.&nbsp; Then  follow the &ldquo;short hike&rdquo; trails back to Friendship Park.<br>
  <br>
<strong>Stout-hearted Hike (red  path, 9.4 mile loop, 1300 ft gain):&nbsp;</strong> Go  South on PVDE, then down the Marymount Trail (H) to PVD South (26th  St).&nbsp; Hike up Forrestal Drive and the  Pirate Trail (G) in the Forrestal Nature Reserve.&nbsp; Neighborhood streets (Coolheights,  Floweridge, and Ganado Drives) connect to the &ldquo;intermediate hike&rdquo; on Crest  Road.&nbsp; Follow the green path to the Miraleste  Canyon Trail and then back to Friendship Park on the &ldquo;short hike&rdquo; trails.</p>
