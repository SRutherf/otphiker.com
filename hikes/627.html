<p>DISTANCE: 6 miles round trip<br>
ELEVATION: 1,100 feet</p>

<p>DIRECTIONS TO TRAILHEAD: Drive up the Angeles Crest Highway to Eagles Roost Picnic Area, 4 miles east of Buckhorn & about 40 miles from La Canada. Park at the picnic area just west of a large brown highway maintenance building.  An Adventure Pass is required for parking.</p>

<p>HIKE DESCRIPTION: Cross the highway & descend west on the unmarked fire road into the head of Little Rock Creek.  Follow the road about 1/2 mile & watch for a trail that takes off from the road to your right. It descends steeply at first & then levels out to a gentle downhill grade.  This is known as the Rattlesnake Trail.</p>

<p>Within another 1/2 mile or so, through a forest of pine, fir, cedar & oak, you will come to a small stream bed.  This is the upper part of Littlerock Creek. For a short hike, make this your destination, & after exploring upstream through the cedar trees, return the way you came.  When there's water, there is a small waterfall in this area.</p>

<p>For a moderate hike, continue on down the trail another two miles to the main part of Littlerock Creek. There you will intersect the Burkhart Trail.  Return from this point after exploring the beautiful area. When there's water, there's a beautiful stream & waterfall.</p>

<p>For a strenuous hike, a right turn at the trail junction will take you to Burkhart Saddle, Pleasant View Ridge, & even on to the desert.  While very scenic, this is a long, hard trip.  A left turn at the same junction will take you to Buckhorn Campground in about another three more miles.  From Buckhorn you can return the way you came, or take the exit road from the campground back up to the highway, & hike four miles back along the highway to your car at Eagles Roost</p>
