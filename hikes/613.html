<p>Trailhead Directions: From Red Box take Mount Wilson Road to unsigned Eaton Saddle and park there.</p>

<p>From Eaton Saddle make gentle climb on the fire road to unsigned Markham Saddle.  Then take the Mount Lowe East Trail and make a gentle climb to East-West Trail Junction and make a right hand "U" turn and continue climbing on the West Trail till you reach the top of Mount Lowe. If you don't want to go any further you may return the way you came.</p>

<p>From the top of Mount Lowe descend a little bit till you come to a "Y" and take the left hand branch and continue descending on the West Trail.  This descent is pretty steep.  Eventually you reach the fire road and make a left turn.  As you go down the gently descending fire road you will notice there are two trails marked Mount Lowe East Trail.  It branches into two trails near the bottom so when you go back take the one you come across first.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter you come to a "Y" of the fire road.  Take the left branch.  After a short gentle climb you reach the Inspiration Point where there is a shelter and a great lunch spot.  If you don't want to go any further take the East Trail back which is a pretty steep uphill climb (about 1000 ft.).  When you reach East-West Trail junction be sure to stay on the East Trail (right hand side branch going down).</p>

<p>From Inspiration Point continue on the level fire road, which was formerly known as the OM and M railroad till it comes to an abrupt end.  This end point is known as the Panorama Point and is the end of the hike.  Return the same way as mentioned in the paragraph above.</p>
