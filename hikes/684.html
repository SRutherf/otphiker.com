<p>Distance: 8 miles RT.<br>
Elevation gain: 1000 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 101 Freeway to Newbury Park (just past 1000 Oaks). Exit the 101 Freeway on Wendy Drive and go south (left) for about 4 miles. Turn west (right) on Lynn Road and after about 1.6 miles turn left on Via Goleto which leads directly into the park.</p>

<p> The Hike: From the parking lot, follow the road until coming to a trail that crosses a big field on the left, which after 1/2 mile brings us to the beginning of Old Boney Road.  Walk uphill on the road, eventually coming to a sharp hairpin turn to the right. A short side trip from this point takes us to a view of the waterfall.  To get there, we go upstream on the path, turning right as we come to a side stream, then upstream to the waterfalls.</p>

<p>After returning to the hairpin turn, continue on the road for about 3/4 mile until coming to a fork.  Take the left fork and reach the Old Cabin Site.  Other than a rock fireplace and chimney, the only visible evidence of a cabin is a level area with some rocks, indicating the cabin outline and floor. Downhill from the cabin site there is a monument to the memory of Richard Danielson.</p>

<p>Our hike continues on the road, dropping down slightly as it passes then crosses the stream.  The next 1/2 mile is up the steep slope on the north side of the stream where we turn left on Old Boney Road.  In about 1/2 mile, turn right and descend on the Fossil Trail and rejoin the main road by turning left at the trail junctions, then right up the road. Near the end, after crossing a bridge, you follow the lower trail to the left to the parking lot.</p>

<p>History: This land is the longtime tribal land of the Chumash. The park has been designated as the Satwiwa Native American Indian Natural Area. It was also a ranch in the 1940's, raising horses, cattle and sheep. The old cabin was once used by ranch hands when they grazed their cattle and sheep in the high meadows. The name of the park, Ranch Sierra Vista/Satwiwa relfects this past history.</p>
