<center><h3><b>Kanan Dume - Zuma Ridge - Encinal Canyon</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 9.4 miles RT<br> 
Elevation gain: 1800 ft.</p>

<p>Summary: The hike plan is to climb the nearby east ridge of Zuma Canyon, switchback our way down to the bottom of the canyon, cross the creek on the "Edison Road", then climb back out of the canyon to the Zuma Ridge trail which traverses the entire west ridge of Zuma Canyon, proceed north to just short of Encinal Canyon Road where we intercept the Backbone trail which we take east back to the trailhead.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: From PCH, go north on Kanan Dume Road until you go through the tunnel, park in the parking area on the left side of the road (mileage paddle N9 LA 9.50).</p>

<p>From the 101, take Kanan Dume Road south. About 2 miles beyond the intersection with Mulholland you’ll see the parking area on the right. If you go through the tunnel, you’ve gone too far. There are no restrooms at the trailhead.</p>

<p>The Hike: The first half mile is a bit tricky, as there are several false trails. Take the nearly obscure trail starting just around the base of the slope south of the parking lot. This steep switchback trail leads up to the top of the east ridge where you will come to a fork. Continue straight ahead at the fork and start to go down from the ridge into the canyon. Very soon you'll come to another fork - go right and go downhill.</p>

<p> You will make the right hand choice at two more forks on the way down. Make sure that you reach the stream bed where you intersect the Edison Road that crosses Zuma Canyon (you may have to boulder bound to the south to find the road depending on where you finally reach the stream). Turn right and start back up the road to the top of the west ridge the Zuma Ridge trail (actually a fire road).</p>

<p>Turn right and follow the ridge north past Buzzard's Roost to the intersection with the Backbone trail where you will turn right again and proceed back to the trailhead.</p>

<p>Refreshments at the trailhead.</p>
