<p>Distance: 6.2 mi. RT.<br>
Elevation gain = 500 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:</strong> Turn north off of PCH on Bonsall Dr. approximately 0.9 miles west of Kanan-Dume Road. Continue north on Bonsall for about a mile until it ends in a dirt parking lot. The rest rooms are south of the parking area and trailhead. <b>Note to drivers returning to PCH:</b> Bonsall Dr. has no eastward access onto PCH; you must take the small connector road, Rainsford Place, and come out via the stop light on Busch Dr.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike: </strong>The basic hike is a combination of essentially all of the well marked trails in the lower part of Zuma Canyon. A short access trail leads to the Ocean View Trail which climbs to the east ridge above Zuma Canyon. It’s a moderate grade and represents the majority of the basic hike's elevation gain.</p>

<p>After first attaining the lower portion of the ridge, a sign is encountered, and we have our first good panoramic view of Point Dume, which is due south. A couple of hundred yards further brings us to a second sign at the junction of the Canyon View Trail and the Kanan-Edison (fire) Road. Rabbits should continue up (and back) the overgrown fire road for a distance and time to their liking. For the record the Zuma Canyon connector trail is 1.3 miles past the junction.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred yards past the junction on the Canyon View Trail gets us to a small ridge and the hike’s apex. Continuing on the trail returns us to the canyon floor and with a right turn, the Scenic Trail gets us deeper into the canyon. The northward traveling Zuma Canyon Trail disappears about 0.7 miles past the last junction and modest boulder hopping of a couple of hundred yards gets us to a small dam.</p>

<p>Return back down the canyon and turn right onto the Zuma Loop Trail. The optional higher ground mini-loop is recommended. Continuing down the trail we pass the cutoff to the Busch Drive trail head, and return back to our trailhead.</p>
<p>BYO refreshments in the shade of the trees, just south of the parking lot.
