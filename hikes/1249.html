<p>Hike #1249<br>
Jones Peak from Bailey Trail<br>
October 28, 2015<br>

<p>Sam Prum, Hike Leader</p>

<p><b>Basic Hike:</b> To Peak: 6.6 mi. RT, max. elevation change = 2350 ft.</p>

<p><b>Alternative Hikes:</b><br>
(1) To Cabin: 4.4 mi. RT, max. elevation change = 1300 ft.;<br>
(2) Jones Peak Crossover Connector Trail to Mt. Wilson Trail Loop Option: 8.1 mi. RT, max. elevation change = 2500 ft.</p>

<p><b>Directions to Trailhead:</b> From the 210 Freeway take the Michillinda Blvd. off-ramp and go north on Michillinda. After about 1.2 miles turn right (east) at Grandview. Turn left (north) at the third street, Grove. Grove will dead-end at Bailey Canyon Park. Go through the gate and park in the parking lot. If the lot is full there is plenty of parking along Grove just before the park entrance. There is a restroom in the park.</p>

<p><b>Basic Hike:</b> Is up and back on the Bailey Canyon Trail to Jones Peak. It is not an easy hike, it is steep, but the trail is in good condition.</p>

<p><b>Jones Peak/Crossover Trail Loop Option:</b> From Jones Peak, return to the saddle below Jones Peak, then go north about .25 miles to the signed connector trail junction to the Wilson trail. Take this "crossover" connector trail to the junction with the Wilson trail, then proceed all the way down to the Mt. Wilson trailhead. From there take the Carter Ave. back to the Bailey trailhead.</p>

<p><b>Shorter Options:</b><br>
1) Hike up the Bailey Canyon trail for 2.2 miles (one way) and 1300 feet elevation gain to the Old Cabin site. All that is left of the cabin are some low stone walls. It is shady there and a short trail leads down to the stream with lots of trees.</p>

<p>2) Hike up the Canyon View Nature Trail, which goes to the falls. This trail branches off the Bailey Canyon Trail after .45 miles with a total distance to the falls one way from the park of about .75 miles and 300 feet gain.</p>

<p>3) Another short loop that could be combined with the Falls Trail is the Live Oak Nature Trail, which begins by crossing a bridge .3 miles from the Park.</p>
