<center><h3><b>Rocky Peak Ending at Corriganville - Shuttle</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 7 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1550 ft.</p>

<p>Summary: The area consists of dramatic sandstone formations, which have served as backdrops for movies since movies were invented. In fact the hike ends at the famous Corrigan Movie Ranch, known as Corriganville. Besides movie making, we may see evidence of wildlife: turkey vultures, red-tailed hawks, bobcats, raccoons, deer, opossums, etc. On the return path, we'll traverse the wildlife tunnel under the 118 freeway, and experience native wall paintings offered by other forms of "wildlife".</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: For non-Valley people: Assemble at the Hummingbird trailhead. Take the 118 freeway west-bound, exit at Kuehner Dr., turn north and park immediately on either side of Kuehner Dr.</p>

<p>For Valley people: Assemble at Corriganville parking lot. Take 118 freeway westbound, exit at Kuehner Dr., and turn south. Drive 1.1 miles to Smith Road (2nd stoplight), turn left, drive to end and park in lot. Combine drivers into 1 or 2 cars and return to the group already at the Hummingbird Trailhead.</p>

<p>The Hike: We start on the Hummingbird trail climbing up toward the Simi Hills, paralleling the 118 freeway, stopping to visit caves and a rock house along the way. At about 2.5 miles, we get to the Rocky Peak road where we turn left and climb up another mile to the Rocky Peak cutoff. </p>

<p>The old approach to the peak at this point began as a road, followed by a scramble up to the peak. Recently, this approach is seriously overgrown which may require proceeding 0.45 mi further on Rocky Peak road and then looking for a use trail that leads off to the right over and around a small peak (West Peak) <a href="../aerialphotomaps/RockyPeakDetail.jpg">(See Detail of Rocky Peak Access Trail).</a> Only after getting around West Peak can Rocky Peak be seen. Continue on the trail down to a saddle between the two peaks, then scramble up the rocks to the peak.</p>

<p>Retracing our steps back off the peak and reaching Rocky Peak fire road,we turn left and proceed about 2 miles (passing the Hummingbird Trail junction on our right) until we get to the cutoff for Corriganville which leads us ever downward toward the busy 118 freeway. We pass through the wildlife tunnel created to allow movement of the animals between foraging areas without having to cross the freeway, and continue down to the Corriganville Movie Ranch with its signposts and photographs detailing the famous old movies that were filmed there.</p>

<p>Refreshments will be served in the Ranch parking lot. After the party, Valley people will transport non-Valley drivers to their cars at the Hummingbird Trailhead.
