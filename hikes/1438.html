<p><strong>Direction to Trailhead:&nbsp; </strong>From PCH, go north on Las Virgenes (Malibu Canyon Road).  After passing Piuma Road, make a left turn into Tapia Park and park.&nbsp; From the 101, go south on Las Virgines Road.&nbsp; Just before Piuma Road, turn right into the park, and park.&nbsp; Restrooms available at parking area and at both parks.&nbsp; This is a State Park with an entrance fee of $11 for Seniors</p> 

<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> From trailhead proceed north on the Backbone Trail. &nbsp; Stay on path until we come to a parking lot in Malibu Creek State Park. &nbsp; Just before the parking lot and wood fence make a right at the trail marker and water faucet. &nbsp; This trail goes between the gravel road and the oak trees & then winds up a small hill.&nbsp; Make a left up to the top of the knoll. &nbsp; Follow the trail down, (short, but steep) back to the gravel road. &nbsp; Take the trail on the left side of the gravel road (marked by a 15 mph sign) for about 300 yards. &nbsp; Turn left at the hike sign and picnic table. &nbsp; For those in need of a restroom continue down the gravel road for about 100 yards). &nbsp; Path at picnic table is a small nature trail. &nbsp; Return to the trailhead in Tapia Park.</p>

<p>Many options exist for those wanting a longer hike.&nbsp; From here you can either hike to the south end of the dam in Malibu Creek and return or hike around Tapia Park. &nbsp; Some may be venturous enough to continue to follow the Backbone Trail south to a stopping place of their choosing.</p>
