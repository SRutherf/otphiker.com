<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp; </strong>There are two hike options:</p>

<p><strong>Option 2:&nbsp;</strong>  9 mile round trip.&nbsp; At the junction of the Panorama Trail with Brea Blvd go 0.25 mile north to Ashburn Terrace.&nbsp; Cross Brea Blvd.&nbsp; The Lost Trail continues west along the white fence about 1 mi.&nbsp; You go through a double culvert under Bastanchury and the Brea Dam Trail continues parallel to the Fullerton Golf Course for about 0.75 mile to a junction with the Union Pacific right-of-way.&nbsp; Turn left and go about 0.1 mile along the right-of-way under two overpasses to the junction with the Juanita Cook Greenbelt just up a little hill.&nbsp; Go right here for about 0.75 mile until you reach Laguna Lake.&nbsp; Go west and all the way around the lake enjoying the many waterfowl, some resident permanently and some migratory.&nbsp; The lake was recently dredged by the city and is clear as a bell.&nbsp; Don't feed the waterfowl. Return the way you came.</p> 

<p>Elevation gains are negligible.</p>

<p><strong>Restrooms:&nbsp;</strong> There is a portapotty at the east end of Laguna Lake and a luxury restroom at the west end. There are also luxury restrooms at the Tennis Center behind St. Jude Hospital, which are reached by going left uphill from the main trail a short distance before reaching the culverts. Those of you who are taking the short hike and feel the call will have to use the Carl's Jr. at Brea and Bastanchury.</p>

<p><strong>Refreshments:&nbsp;</strong> Walk across Bastanchury to Mountain View Park on the NW corner.</p>
