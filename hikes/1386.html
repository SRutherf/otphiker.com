<p><b>GPS Data:</b><br>
RT = 8.0 mi.<br>
Max elevation change = 1000 ft.</p>

<p><b>Trailhead Directions:</b>&nbsp; Drive north on Hwy 2 (Angeles Crest) from the 210 freeway past the Clear Creek Information Center to Sulphur Springs Road (3N17) which is about 2.5 miles past the Chilao Visitor Center turnoff.&nbsp; Turn left and proceed about 100' to the paved parking lot and park. &nbsp; There is a restroom at the parking lot.</p>

<p><b>The Hike:</b>&nbsp; We proceed northerly on the Pacific Crest Trail (starts uphill out of the parking lot opposite the entrance).&nbsp; The route descends through oak, manzanita and open chaperal.&nbsp; Bear right at the junction of the trail and the extension of the road out of Singing Pines Camp and continue north until reaching Sulpher Springs Road.&nbsp; Turn right and proceed into the campground for lunch.&nbsp; Return the same way.</p>

<p>Those hikers desiring a shorter hike can turn around whenever they wish.</p>

<p>Hikers should be aware that the Silver Mocasin Trail intersects the PCT adjacent to the parking lot.&nbsp; An alternate hike would be to follow the Silver Mocasin Trail west 3.0 mi. to Horse Flats campground.</p>
