<center><h3><b>Topanga/Tuna Canyons to the Coast</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 1) 2.6 mi. RT; 2) 5 mi. RT; 3) 8.4 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1) nil; 2) 700 ft.; 3) 1550 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take Topanga Canyon Boulevard to the community of Fernwood and take Fernwood Pacific up the canyon.  You should see a Fire Station on the right after you turn.  The road changes its name to Tuna Canyon Road part way up.  Proceed to 2175 Tuna Canyon Road (private residence).  There is plenty of parking on the property, however, hikers are strongly urged to form carpools for the next segment since parking is limited at the Conservancy entrance. There are no restroom facilities at the Conservancy.</p>

<p>Drive 1.5 miles up Tuna Canyon Road to the Conservancy on the right side and park.  Be careful not to get on Saddle Peak Road ½ mile up.  Also, if you go a half mile past the Conservancy, you will be on a twisty, narrow one-way road to the coast.</p>

<p>The Hike: All hikes proceed from the entrance to the second road turnoff to the left. Ignore the first turnoff road to the right (leads to prepared building sites).</p>

<p>1) Short hike: Turn left at the second turnoff, proceed on road to plateau. Follow the two tire tracks to the flat top. Do not follow the road around the plateau to the right. After taking in the various views, go to the opposite end and follow the trail down, then up the second hill for more views.  Return the way you came.</p>

<p>2) Medium Hike: Continue past the second left turnoff and proceed to the large water tank.  On the return, take the short hike above.</p>

<p>3) Full Hike: Continue on the road past the water tank down to the back gate.  Take Big Rock Road down to Pacific Coast Highway (a stoplight).  There does not appear to be any beach access here.  On the return, take the short hike.
