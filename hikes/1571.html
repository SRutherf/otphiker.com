<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp; </strong>Take Angeles Crest Highway 2 to Clear Creek Junction (the junction of Angeles Crest Highway and Angeles Forest Highway - N3). Turn left onto Angeles Forest Highway and immediately park on either side of the road.&nbsp; The ranger station is on the left where we wll have our refreshments, so the left is preferable if available. </p>
          
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> You can  begin this hike by going up the Josephine fire road across from our parking  area near Clear Creek Junction. There are four 
options:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong>. Turn around at the Junction (1250 ft. climb) and  return the way you came for 4.8 miles RT.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2.</strong> Turn right at the Junction (1250 ft. climb) and go along the Josephine Saddle, then down the Colby Canyon trail to the highway at the Colby  Canyon trailhead, turn right and walk back on the highway to the trailhead for  5.9 mi RT.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3. </strong>Turn left at the Junction, go up to Josephine Peak  (2080 ft. total climb from trailhead) and return the way you came for 7.8 miles  RT.</p>
<p><strong>Option 4.</strong> Same as Option 3 except continue past the Junction along  Josephine Saddle, then down the Colby Canyon trail to the highway at the Colby  Canyon trailhead, turn right and walk back along the road to the trailhead for 8.9 miles RT.</p>
<p><strong>Option to avoid the treck along the highway.</strong> After hitting Angeles Crest Highway at the end of Colby Canyon, look for a trailhead on the south of the highway.&nbsp; Follow the trail to the west that parallels the highway. &nbsp;Alternately, go for 0.3 miles along the highway and look for a trail leading from the south of the parking lot that heads to the west toward Clear Creek Junction.&nbsp; Not shown on map.</p>
<p>There is one toilet at the Clear Creek ranger station and at least one more at the top of the road down to Switzers (0.5 mi. east on the highway 2).  </p>
<p>BYO refreshments will be at the ranger station.</p>
