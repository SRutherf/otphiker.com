<center><h3><b>Altadena Fire Roads and El Prieto Canyon</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Overview:  The hike is a total of 6.2 miles on fire roads and a final leg up El Prieto Canyon.  It is totally within the Angeles National Forest just North of Altadena.  A map (which will be provided), and following directions are essential.  Shorter and longer variations are available.</p>

<p>Trailhead: Exit the 210 freeway on Lincoln Ave. in North/West Pasadena. Proceed North on Lincoln and <u>notice</u> the Altadena Community Garden and Loma Alta Park at about 1.8 miles from the freeway (this is where the after hike party will be held).  Continue up Lincoln another block and turn left on Canyon Crest Road.  Follow the (very) curvy Canyon Crest Road to its junction with Rising Hill Road (just before CC dead ends).  Proceed up Rising Hill.  It will turn to dirt above address 4630.  Continue another .25 miles, under and past the power lines, to the parking and trailhead.  There are no restrooms at the trailhead.</p>   

<p>Hike: The hike begins at the yellow gate (1920 ft.), and proceeds up the fire road .25 miles to a junction with the road that comes up from Millard Camp.  Go left (away from Millard), and the road reaches into El Prieto Canyon and crosses the small stream.  About 150 yards past the stream, note, but <u>do not take</u>, the signed El Prieto Trail that drops into the canyon.</p>
 
<p>Continue up the road to the major junction with a road/trail that leads north to Oakwilde (2380 ft.).  Stay left at the junction and follow the road (2N66) down for 3.1 miles until it drops into El Prieto Canyon (1280 ft.).  An obvious sign then directs us 2 miles up the canyon, toward the upper junction with the fire road.</p>

<p>There are numerous side trails in the canyon, always stay on the best path near the stream.  After about 1.4 miles of climbing up the canyon you will be on a stretch that is away from the stream.  A sharp bend to the left, just below a stand of cactus will be encountered.  The bend is also a junction with an upward leading trail.  Take the upward trail a couple of hundred yards back to the cars. </p>
   
<p>Variations:  A shorter hike with a bit of a loop may be obtained by starting as above and turning back at any time.  The mini-loop feature is obtained if one drops into El Prieto Canyon at the sign above the stream crossing.  Look for the oak to find the trail back to the cars.</p>

<p>Tigers may add another mile and a couple of hundred feet by ignoring the oak and continuing up the canyon trail until the upper fire road is reached.  Then come back down the road to the cars.</p>

<p>Party: Loma Alta Park, about 1.9 miles back down the hill.  Enter the park from the South on Palm Street.</p>
