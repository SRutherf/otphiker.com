<center><h3><b>Mount Washington</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 4 miles RT<br>
Elevation Gain: 400 ft.</p>

<p>History: In the late 1800’s, Mt. Washington was sub-divided by realtor Robert Marsh who, with Arthur St. Claire Perry, built an incline railway to get residents as well as home buyers up and down the hill. At the top of the railway, they built the Mt. Washington Hotel which was completed in 1908. In 1925, Paramahansa Yogananda acquired the hotel, and converted it into the Self Realization Fellowship’s headquarters.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Parking lot of the Southwest Museum which is located one-half mile west of the Pasadena (110) Freeway. Exit at Ave 43 and follow directional signs. Street address: 234 Museum Drive.</p>

<p>The Hike: We leave the parking lot and walk down to Marmion Way, then south-west to a series of stairs which steeply march up the hill to Canyon Vista Drive. These stairs replace the tracks (torn up in 1919) of the Mt. Washington Railway. Two cars were pulled up and down by cable running under wood planking.</p>

<p>After a stiff half-mile climb, Canyon Vista merges with Mt. Washington Dr. and we bear right, walking along a fence-lined walkway until we reach San Rafael Ave. We turn right as we crest the mountain (940 ft.) and we soon see the iron gates of the Self Realization Fellowship on our right. We will stroll the grounds, and rest in one of their meditation gardens.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we continue along San Rafael Ave. past the Mt. Washington School and turn left onto Sea View Lane. This was a dirt road known as Central Terrace until the 1930’s, and was noted for trapping automobiles after the winter rains. After a quarter mile, the pavement ends and we begin a U-shaped traverse around a knoll – hoping for a clear day so we can see vistas of Santa Monica, the Palos Verdes peninsula, Catalina Island, and David Lillback’s house.</p>

<p>Eventually, we regain pavement and continue on to San Rafael Ave. where we bear left and then right to Moon Ave. We begin our descent down Moon Ave., Crane Drive, and finally Museum Drive ending back at the museum. Lunch will be at the cars where we can discretely have our refreshments, etc.</p>

<p>Hikers now have a choice. They can bid farewell for an early departure or they can visit the museum which is devoted to the Native Cultures ranging from Alaska to South America. Entry fee in 1999 was $6.00 – unknown as to senior discounts.</p>
