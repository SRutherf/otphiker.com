<p><strong>Distance:</strong>&nbsp; 5 miles round trip<br>
<strong>Elevation Gain/Loss:</strong>&nbsp; 1600  feet</p>
<p><strong>Directions To The Trailhead:</strong>&nbsp; From  Interstate 5 in Burbank take the Burbank Blvd exit.&nbsp; Northbound travelers  take the Burbank east fork and turn right.&nbsp; Southbound take the Burbank  exit and turn left.&nbsp; In a quarter mile use the middle lane to turn right  on N 3rd St, then make a quick left on E Harvard Rd.&nbsp; In 1.5  miles turn right on Wildwood Canyon Rd and enter the park.&nbsp; The Vital Link  Trail has four trailheads and we will be using the third.&nbsp; Look for a  stone restroom building on the left with picnic tables and parking on the  right.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp; </strong>This hike is  short but very steep.&nbsp; It begins behind the restrooms (on yellow track) and quickly climbs  to a ridge.&nbsp; Those wishing a shorter easier loop can turn left here (on red track) and follow  the trail to the park entrance and then walk back up the road to our  cars.&nbsp; The rest of us turn right and continue climbing to a signed  junction.&nbsp; Again, those wishing a shorter hike can turn right here (on green track) down to  Wildwood Canyon Rd and back to the cars passing some tables along the  way.&nbsp; This also makes a nice variation for the return trip.&nbsp; Tigers  turn left at this junction and continue (on yellow track) climbing to the red-and-white radio  tower looming above.&nbsp; At the top you will find a cement lounge chair where  one person can rest and catch their breath.&nbsp; Those who are not completely  exhausted at this point can make their way to the Verdugo Motorway, turn right,  and in about a mile reach Verdugo Peak which at 3100 feet is the high point of  the range.&nbsp; Unfortunately this high point is fenced off to protect a  building full of electronic equipment, but the views are still outstanding if  the day is clear.&nbsp; Return the way you came.</p>
Refreshments will be served at the tables near  the parking area.
