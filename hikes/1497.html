There are no  bathrooms or water fills at the trailhead, but there are some if you drive down  the hill to the Millard campground parking area.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:</strong> You&rsquo;ll start out east along the paved Mount Lowe Road. You&rsquo;ll soon  take a left onto the Sunset Ridge Trail. Eventually you&rsquo;ll come to a junction  where the Sunset Ridge Trail goes right, and the Sunset Trail goes left. Take  the left option and continue through the canyon. Beware there are several creek  crossings here. After another mile from the junction, you&rsquo;ll come across the  mine (metal grid bars entry). There&rsquo;s plenty to explore here including caves, equipment,  building foundations and more. Once you&rsquo;ve had your fill, you&rsquo;ll start going  southward on the Sunset Ridge Trail. This trail can be difficult, but it offers  sweeping views of the area. You&rsquo;ll then go down some switchbacks, meet back up  with Mount Lowe Road, and return to the parking area. We will go clockwise so  we get the shaded valley part first which has water and cooler temps. Nice  trail, make sure you bring plenty of water, and watch out for poison oak. Oaks, big cone spruce provide shade on north facing slopes.  There are alders, maples, and bay trees in the canyon bottom. Good wildflowers  in spring along the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7030972/sunset-ridge-trail-12w18">Sunset Ridge Trail 12W18</a>.<br>

<strong>History:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.simpsoncity.com/hiking/dawnphotos.html" target="_blank">https://www.simpsoncity.com/hiking/dawnphotos.html</a>. Over its 50-plus years, Dawn Mine produced more  stories than gold. Enough gold was recovered to keep various over-optimistic  operators looking for the bonanza that never came. Some unknown prospectors  discovered gold in Millard Canyon in 1895 and small claims were staked and  worked for 7 years with marginal results. Miner Bradford Peck named the mine  for Dawn Ehrenfeld, little daughter of a friend from the Randsburg Mines.  Michael Ryan bought the Dawn Mine in 1902. He bore tunnels into the canyon's  rock walls and was successful for several years. He built a narrow trail up the  steep slope to the Mt. Lowe Railway. Two mules, Jack and Jill, carried the ore  to Dawn Station to be transferred to railcars and taken down to the valley for  milling. After Ryan's death in 1929, the mines set idle for several years. In  1933 Ryan's widow leased the holdings to Hunger, Comstock, and Hilton, who  bored a new, 1,200-foot tunnel and built a small mill. They had good success at  first, but in spite of considerably more digging, the gold petered out. In a  few more years the venture was closed down. In the 1940s and early 1950s, other  miners gave it a try but with no positive results.&nbsp;</p>
