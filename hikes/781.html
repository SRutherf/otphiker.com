Distance: 6 miles RT<br>
Elevation Gain:	1500 ft.</p> 

<p>Directions to Trailhead: The trailhead is south of Tapia Park on the west side of Las Virgenes-Malibu Canyon Road reached either from the 101 or PCH.  The parking lot is south of the bridge.  Restrooms are located under pine trees above the parking lot along the trail.</p>

<p>The Hike: Beyond the restrooms, look for the trail as it makes a sharp left turn and heads south paralleling the Malibu Canyon Road.  In 200 yards, make a right turn onto Mesa Motorway. At about a half mile farther along the trail, <u>go past</u> a road that branches right and dead-ends at a gate. The north slope of the mountain is very steep, and the trail makes a few switchbacks to gain altitude. At one switchback we cross over the ridge and look down into the Malibu Creek gorge, the only stream to cut completely through the Santa Monica Mountains.</p>

<p>The view of Malibu Canyon continues to expand as we gain altitude.  Eventually, we come to a fork in the road where we turn right. One-third mile beyond the fork we turn right at a saddle and walk to the top of Peak 2049.  When we return and come to the fork, those who want to can turn right and drop downhill slightly to Mesa Peak and Overlook.  We then return to the trailhead.</p>
