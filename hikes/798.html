<center><h3><b>Devil's Punchbowl Trail & Devil's Chair</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: Approximately 6 1/2 - 7 miles.<br>
Elevation Gain: 800 feet to 1200 feet.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: From highway SR-14 take the highway SR-138 (Pearblossom Highway) toward Pearblossom.  Go through the town of Pearblossom and as you leave the town watch for the street sign for County Road N6 (Longview Road). Turn right on N6.  N6 makes a number of turns but remains N6.  When in doubt stay on N6.</p>

<p>Turn left on Fort Tejon Road, (still N6). Turn right on Longview (N6). Turn Left on Tumbleweed Road (N6).  Tumbleweed Road becomes Devil's Punchbowl Road (N6).  Continue to the Devil's Punchbowl County Park parking lot (parking fee).</p>

<p>The Hike: Start at the parking lot.  The first sign will tell us to the follow the Burkhart trail as it climbs northwest along the rim of the punchbowl.  We will join an old road at 1/2 mile, pass a small reservoir at 0.07 miles and arrive at a trail junction at 0.08 miles, in a pine grove.  Bear left on the punchbowl trail leading east.  At 3 miles a short spur goes left and then over a narrow, rock-ribbed ridge to the high perch know as the Devils Chair.  We will have lunch there.  After lunch, we return to the cars by re-tracing our steps.</p>

<p>Note: There is a protective fence around the Devil's Chair to keep you from taking an inadvertent plunge.  No matter what the devil may suggest, stay behind the fence because a trip into the Punchbowl from the chair is a one-way ticket to Hell with no return privileges.</p>
