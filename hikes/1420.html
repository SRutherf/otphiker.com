Eaton Saddle to Inspiration Point via West Trail, back via East Trail: RT = 6.4 mi.<br>
To Panorama Point it's an additional 2 miles<br>
Max Elevation Change = 1135 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Trailhead Directions:</strong>&nbsp; From Red Box take Mount Wilson Road to unsigned Eaton Saddle and park there.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> From Eaton Saddle make gentle climb on the fire road to unsigned Markham Saddle.&nbsp; Then take the Mount Lowe East Trail and make a gentle climb to East-West Trail Junction and make a right hand "U" turn and continue climbing on the West Trail till you reach the top of Mount Lowe.&nbsp; If you don't want to go any further you may return the way you came.</p>

<p>From the top of Mount Lowe descend a little bit till you come to a "Y" and take the left hand branch and continue descending on the West Trail.&nbsp; This descent is pretty steep.&nbsp; Eventually you reach the fire road and make a left turn.&nbsp; As you go down the gently descending fire road you will notice there are two trails marked Mount Lowe East Trail.&nbsp; It branches into two trails near the bottom, so when you go back take the one you come across first.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter you come to a "Y" of the fire road.&nbsp; Take the left branch.&nbsp; After a short gentle climb you reach the Inspiration Point where there is a shelter and a great lunch spot.&nbsp; If you don't want to go any further take the East Trail back which is a pretty steep uphill climb (about 1000 ft.).&nbsp; When you reach East-West Trail junction be sure to stay on the East Trail (right hand side branch going down).&nbsp; If you do not like the steep climb, take the road back all the way to the trailhead.</p>

<p>From Inspiration Point continue on the level fire road, which was formerly known as the OM & M railroad till it comes to an abrupt end.&nbsp; This end point is known as the Panorama Point and is the end of the hike.&nbsp; Return the same way as mentioned in the paragraph above.</p>
