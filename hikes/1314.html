<p><strong>Hike #1314<br>
  Mt. Waterman from Buckhorn<br>
  April 12, 2017</strong><br>
  <br>
<strong>Ron Obert, Hike Leader</strong>
<p><strong>Summary:&nbsp; </strong>The hike is along the nice but thinly forested high country of the Angeles National  Forest.&nbsp; The basic hike is an out and  back to the rocky ridge that forms the summit of Mt. Waterman at 8,038  feet.&nbsp; An alternate version allows completing a loop by returning down the dirt road that is part of the Mt.  Waterman ski area.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> Leave  the 210 freeway at Highway 2, the Angeles Crest Highway.&nbsp; Continue up the Angeles Crest Highway until  mile marker 58.02, the Buckhorn day use area. Turn left and park. There is a restroom adjacent to the parking/picnic area. Use your Golden Age Passport for  parking. </p>
<p><strong>Hike:&nbsp;</strong> Begin the hike by exiting the parking area, crossing Hwy. 2 and continuing on the dirt road beyond (which will be the return path for those who complete the loop version). After about a quarter of a mile the trail crosses the dirt road. Turn left and continue up the trail. In a little less than 2 miles there will be a first look down at the Los Angeles basin.&nbsp;  A bit further, a junction with the trail that leads to Twin Peaks will be reached.&nbsp; Only real tigers should choose to go toward Twin Peaks.&nbsp; As the ridge like summit of Mt. Waterman is approached, there are trail choices and the higher choices will get you to the boulder outcroppings that form the summit. &nbsp;Returning as you came will result in a 6.7  mile hike with a gain of 1200 feet.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Those wishing to complete the 7.0 mile loop should continue west along the crest and drop down a bit to find the ski areas upper dirt road.&nbsp; Follow the dirt road down through the ski area to the crossing of the trail near the trailhead.</p>
<p>A map will be supplied on hike  day.&nbsp;</p>
