<p>Directions to Trailhead: From the 210 eastbound, exit Sierra Madre Blvd/Altadena Dr.  Turn left (north) at the first light (Altadena Dr.) and go 1.6 miles to the park entrance.  From the 210 westbound, exit San Gabriel Blvd/San Marino Blvd, turn right (north) at the second light and go 1.5 miles to the park entrance.</p>

<p>The Hike: Starts at Eaton Canyon Nature Center and continues on a shadeless fire road to Henninger Flats.  Along the way there are nice views of LA if it is not hazy or cloudy.  At the flats, there is a Nature Center and picnic area amid the trees.  Total distance is 6 miles round trip and 1400 ft elevation gain.  If you want a longer hike, continue on the fire road as far as you want.  Another option is to hike to Eaton Falls, a 3 mile round trip. Bathrooms are available at the Nature Center and refreshments will be served in the parking lot.</p>
