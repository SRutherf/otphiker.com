<center><h3><b>Palos Verdes Peninsula Del Cerro Park to Inspiration Point and Back</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 6-7 mile loop<br>
Elevation Gain: 1200 ft.</p>

<p>This will be a new hike for the OTPers, an area we have never visited before.  If the weather cooperates, the shoreline and ocean views are majestic!</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: From the 405 Freeway take Crenshaw Boulevard south until it deadends at Del Cerro Park.  Turn right into the parking lot. There are NO restrooms available at the Trailhead.  There is a MacDonald’s/Valero Gas Station on the southeast side of Crenshaw Blvd. at Skypark Drive, 4.2 miles south of the 405 freeway (about 4.6 miles north of the Trailhead).</p>

<p>The Hike: The hike starts on the Rattlesnake Trail at the stone pilasters just west of the entrance to Del Cerro Park.  We’ll skirt the Vanderlip Estate, proceed through the Portuguese Bend Nature Preserve, the rural community of Portuguese Bend, (well known for it’s landslide of 1954 with the remaining homes raised up on steel jacks.).  We’ll cross Palos Verdes Drive South and venture out to Inspiration Point for a breathtaking view of the coastline.  We’ll return up through the Portuguese Bend Nature Preserve and eventually connect with the Crenshaw Trail at the water tank (there is a pit toilet here, but we don’t pass this way until we’re almost back) and head up to Del Cerro Park and refreshments.  This is not an out and back hike, because of all the numerous trails it will be wise to stick together.  We don’t want any lost hikers.</p>

<p>For those looking for a shorter hike: At the bottom of the Rattlesnake Trail you can cross over at that time to the Crenshaw Trail at the water tank and return to the park.</p>
