<p>Hike 1221 <br>
April 15, 2015<br>
Verdugo Mountains - South Traverse</p>

<p>Hike Leader, Mike Dillenbach</p>

<p>GPS Data<br>
RT Basic Hike = 5.7 mi.<br>
Max Elevation = 1450 ft.</p>

<p>RT Verdugo Peak add-on = 4.6 mi.<br>
Elevation Delta = 636 ft.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: From the I-210 freeway, exit at Ocean View Blvd. Turn south until it intersects Verdugo Road (divided).<br>
Turn right onto S. Verdugo Road and continue going south.<br>
S. Verdugo Road soon turns and merges with La Crescenta Ave. which enters and ends coming in from the right. Stay on S. Verdugo Road as it now bears south-easterly (left).<br>
Stay on S. Verdugo Road as it bears to the south (right) at a Y intersection and continue on what is now called Canada Blvd.<br>
After about 0.2 miles, watch for the Country Club Sign and make a sharp right onto Country Club Drive.<br>
Turn left onto Beaudry Boulevard and follow it to where it changes to Beaudry Terrace. Park on the street.<br>
<i>(This is in Glendale, not to be confused with the Country Club Drive in Burbank).</i></p>

<p>From the SR-2 freeway exit at Mountain Street in Glendale, turn west and go to Verdugo Road. Turn right (north) on Verdugo and at the Y bear left onto Canada Blvd. and follow the instructions above.</p>

<p>The Hike: We start up the fire road alongside a debris basin. At 0.4 miles the road forks into Beaudry South and Beaudry North. We'll take the north road up (not as steep!). At 2.3 miles the two roads meet again, we continue on Verdugo Fire Road about 1/2 mile to have lunch.</p>

<p>After lunch, we return by taking the same road back to the fork and go right on Beaudry South. About 3/4 miles down the road is a Y, going left is the shorter way back.</p>

<p>For those of you who want a longer hike you can go up to Verdugo Peak and back (10.3 mi RT total).</p>
