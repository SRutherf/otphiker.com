Lowe East Trail to the left. Continue hiking on the Mount Lowe Motorway (generally to the  west). Bypass the junction where the trail makes a sharp 180 degree turn  to the left (blue trail on hike map). Do not take this trail. Instead, continue west on the Bear Canyon Trail leading to the Tom Sloan Saddle.  Arrive at the Tom Sloane Saddle and the  intersection of the Bear Canyon Trail and Dawn Mine Trail (5-way trail intersection). Take the second on the right, unmarked trail, to the left of the Tom Sloane Saddle sign.  Follow the trail to the Brown Mountain summit as it meanders up and down along a ridge with  four false summits. The fifth summit is Brown Mountain. Take  a break and enjoy the views. Return on the same trail/fire road to Eaton  Saddle. <br>
