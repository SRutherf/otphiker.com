<p>Hike #1293<br>
Charlton Flats Pick-a-Hike<br>
September 28, 2016</p>

<p>Norm Maclean, Hike Leader</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Drive up Angeles Crest Highway to mileage paddle 47.54, then turn left on the Charlton Flats Road.  After about 100 yards take the right downhill branch and drive to the turn around at the end of the road. Go back to the first tables and restrooms where we will meet, at 5240 feet elevation and hopefully cooler weather.</p>

<p>Pick-A-Hike Choices.</p>

<p>1. Vetter Lookout Site. 3 miles RT, 650 ft. elevation gain.</p>

<p>2. Wolf Creek Interpretive Trail, 0.5 miles 10 ft.</p>
 
<p>3. Loop along Silver Moccasin trail to Little Pines campground, then across Hwy. 2 to the saddle between Mt. Mooney and Devils Peak, then back down the road to Charlton Flat entrance road, and back to the starting area.  6 miles and 600 ft total gain.</p>

<p>4. Add the road to Devils Peak, passing a private observatory, or add Mt. Mooney.  Maybe an extra mile.</p>
