<p><strong>Hike 1324<br>
June 21, 2017<br>
Griffith Park &ndash; East Loop</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steve Babcock, Hike Leader</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meet at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary:&nbsp;</strong> This hike explores the eastern portions of Griffith Park.</p>
<p><strong>Directions to trailhead:</strong>&nbsp;  We will meet at the Griffith Park Merry-Go-Round  upper lot.&nbsp; From I-5 north take Griffith Park exit, turn right on Crystal  Springs Drive then left at the Merry-Go-Round sign.&nbsp; From I-5 south take  the Los Feliz west exit, turn right on Los Feliz, turn right on Crystal Springs  Drive then left at the Merry-Go-Round sign.&nbsp; Restrooms are available  nearby, as are pony rides!</p>
<p><strong>Basic Hike (5.6 miles RT, 1464 ft. elevation gain):</strong>&nbsp; Take the Fern  Canyon Nature Trail to Fern Canyon Trail and turn left up to 5 Points.&nbsp; As  of this writing the trail we want from here is closed due to a water project  construction, so we will have to make a short detour along pavement.&nbsp;  Follow the sign to the Joe Klass water stop with shade trees and tables.&nbsp;  Turn right on paved Vista Del Valle Drive and walk past the construction.&nbsp;  Look for a green wooden pump house on the left located at the junction of  Riverside and Hogback Trails.&nbsp; Bear right on the Hogback Trail steeply up  the ridge to Dante&rsquo;s View and Mt. Hollywood.&nbsp; Follow the North Trail  keeping right at two junctions (follow signs for Bee Rock) down to Vista Del  Valle again.&nbsp; Turn right and walk down the pavement a short distance past  a water stop to the Bill Eckert Trail.&nbsp; Follow this down to the Old Zoo  area, past the Bee Rock Trail to take the Upper Old Zoo Trail back to the  parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Short Option (3.3 miles):</strong>&nbsp; Take the Fern  Canyon Trail up to 5 Points, then return via the Coolidge and Lower Beacon  Trails.</p>
<p><strong>Long Option (6.6 miles):&nbsp;</strong> Take Lower Beacon  and Coolidge Trails to 5 Points, then follow the Basic Hike instructions from  there.</p>
<p>Refreshments will be served on the picnic tables  next to the Merry-Go-Round.&nbsp; Hopefully we can get Dan or Phil to record an  OTP group carousel ride! </p>
