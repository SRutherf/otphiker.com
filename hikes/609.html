<p>Temescal Canyon to Skull Rock and Beyond</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Directions to trail head:<br>
a) From Los Angeles head west on the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) to its end and continue north on Pacific Coast Highway. Turn north (right) on Temescal Canyon Road and drive 1.1 miles, cross Sunset Blvd. and into Temescal Gateway Park.<br>
b) Going south on Pacific Coast Highway, turn east (left) on Sunset Blvd., and continue through Pacific Palisades to Temescal Canyon Road, turn left (north) into the parking area.<br>
c) From 405 Fwy. go west on Sunset Blvd. to Pacific Palisades and turn right into Temescal Gateway Park.</p>

<p>The parking fee is now $7. Because the Temescal Gateway Park belongs to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy the State Park coupons are not accepted. Street parking along Temescal Canyon Rd. is a possibility if you don't mind walking a few hundred yards up and across Sunset Blvd. Parking on Sunset is limited to two hours.</p>

<p>And please be aware of the stop signs around the parking area; they have cameras, so come to a full stop. (the fine is $175). Restrooms are in two locations: the lower parking lot and near the campus store.</p>

<p>The hike: Walk up the canyon on the landscaped path past the restrooms. The footpath soon crosses a branch of Temescal Creek. Continue through the canyon. The path ascends moderately to another footbridge and a close-up view of a small waterfall. The path steepens and climbs westward up Temescal Ridge to a signed junction with Temescal Ridge Trail. Continue uphill a half-mile to Skull Rock. Some might want to turn around here, the others can continue on to the Antenna Site, Temescal Peak and even Eagle Peak via Fire Road 30. Return is either retracing your steps through the canyon, or else via the Ridge Trail to the parking lot.</p>
