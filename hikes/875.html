<p>The Hike:  After departing the boat at Prisoner's Landing, we gather and link up with our guide (a mandatory requirement for any hike on non-NPS portion of Santa Cruz) and begin our hike. The path takes us along the coast up and over the undulating terrain until reaching Pelican Bay. After eating lunch, we return the way we came in time to catch the boat at Prisoner's Landing. Although the distance is short, the terrain is steep in many places.</p>
