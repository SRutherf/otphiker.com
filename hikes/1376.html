<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>ATTENTION!!&nbsp; DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND MY CONTROL (LOCKED  GATE) THIS HIKE WILL HAVE A LATE START!</strong></font></p>
<p>7.2 miles RT to Newcomb Pass<br>
Elevation loss/gain 1600 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:</strong>&nbsp; Drive up Angeles Crest Highway 2 to  Red Box and turn right on the Mount Wilson Road.&nbsp; Follow this road about 5  miles keeping right at the forks (follow signs for observatory) until you reach  a locked gate.&nbsp; We will meet here from 9:30 - 10:00 for instructions,  maps, cookies and meet-and-greet.&nbsp; The gate is on a timer and will open at  10:00.&nbsp; Pass through the gate to a large parking lot on the right.&nbsp;  Enter the lot but do not park here.&nbsp; Follow the &ldquo;OTHER PARKING&rdquo; sign to  the upper lot next to the restrooms and Cosmic Caf&eacute;.&nbsp; National Parking  Pass is required.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> From the back of the upper parking lot follow sign  for observatory down a paved walkway to the main road.&nbsp; Turn right and  then a quick left onto the Rim Trail.&nbsp; 0.4 mile from the start you will  reach a picnic area with one table.&nbsp; 0.8 mile from the start you will  reach Vista Point with a rest bench.&nbsp; From here the trail becomes a bit  narrow, steep and slippery in places, so slow down, watch your step and use  caution.&nbsp; 2.1 miles from the start you will cross a big wide  firebreak.&nbsp; 3.6 miles from the start you will arrive at Newcomb Pass with  two tables and an intersection with the Gabrielino Trail.&nbsp; Eat lunch here  and return the way you came, uphill most of the way.</p>
<p>For those desiring a shorter hike you can turn around at any  point, bearing in mind that the return trip will be uphill most of the  way.&nbsp; However far you travel, you will find the Rim Trail to be serene,  scenic and mostly shaded the whole way.&nbsp; If you get back early you can  take a tour of the Mt. Wilson telescope.</p>
<p>Refreshments will be served on the tables  outside of the Cosmic Caf&eacute;.&nbsp; The caf&eacute; itself is closed on Wednesday, but  they leave the free WiFi on.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>
