<p><strong>GPS  Data:</strong><br>
RT = 2.25 miles mostly on pavement (suggests street shoes).<br>
Elevation gain 753 ft., and loss = 676 ft. <br>
Maximum  Gradients: 17.6% Up; 12.7% Down<br>
<br>
<strong>Directions to Trail Head: </strong> The trailhead is in front of the Elysian Heights School located at 1562 Baxter  St. between Echo Park Ave. and Valentine St.&nbsp; Expect difficulties in achieving street  parking, both at the park and the school.&nbsp; We also found the park restrooms to be  poorly maintained. <br>
<br>
<strong>From the south:</strong>&nbsp; 101 northbound, exit Glendale Blvd and head north on Echo Park Ave.&nbsp; Note that  Echo Park Ave. is the eastern boundary of Echo Park park where restrooms are available at the north  end of the park along Park St.&nbsp; Return to Echo Park Ave. heading north.&nbsp; After a  few blocks (including the crossing of Sunset Blvd.) Echo Park Ave. splits.&nbsp; Stay  to the left continuing north on Echo Park Ave. to Baxter St., turn right and  park on the street.<br>
<br>
<strong>From the north:</strong>&nbsp; 101 southbound, exit Alvarado Blvd. (Route 2) going north.&nbsp; Go to Sunset Blvd.  (the sixth street on your right), turn right.&nbsp; Turn right again at the next  street (Park Ave.), stay on Park St. past Glendale Blvd. and park along the  north boundary of the park where restrooms  are available in the park, or continue on Park St. turning left on Echo Park  Ave. (the eastern boundary of the park) heading north.&nbsp; After a few blocks  (including the crossing of Sunset Blvd.) Echo Park Ave. splits.&nbsp; Stay to the  left continuing north on Echo Park Ave. to Baxter St., turn right and park on  the street.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Hike:</strong>&nbsp; Basically, a clockwise  loop &ndash; See map.&nbsp; <strong>Caution:&nbsp; </strong>The hike  traverses 3 hills.&nbsp; The streets are steep (i.e. the need for stairways). &nbsp; Unfortunately, many street signs appear to be missing or obscured by brush or  trees. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.&nbsp;</strong> Starting from the school, we walk  east on Baxter St. past Valentine and Avon Sts. to our first stairway - the Baxter St. Stairs - 231 steps.&nbsp; This  takes us UP to Park Dr. which gives us a view of the downtown sky-scrapers and  the western portion of Elysian Park.&nbsp; From here we can see Mt. Hollywood and Mt.  Lee with the Hollywood sign and the western edge of Elysian Park spreading out  below us.&nbsp; We turn right and continue on Park Dr. in a southerly direction.<br>
<br>
<strong>2.&nbsp;</strong> After passing Ewing St. on  our right, we turn right on Duane St. which sweeps downhill turning left on to  Avon St.&nbsp; Continuing southerly on Avon St., look for Lucretia Ave. opening on  our right and turn right.&nbsp; As Lucretia turns to the left, look for a sidewalk on  our right and just to the left of the driveway of the house at 1891 Lucretia that  leads to our second stairway the Avalon-east  Stairs - 192 steps DOWN, continuing Avalon St. to Echo Park Ave.<br>
<br>
<strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; We turn right and walk north on  Echo Park Ave. continuing past Duane St. until we reach Ewing St.&nbsp; Turning left,  we gamely march UP Ewing Street eventually reaching Preston Ave.&nbsp; We are not yet  on top of this hill, so after resting a bit, we continue UP the Ewing-east Stairs - 25 steps, a narrow  stairway, starting just across Preston to the left of a large building  at 2003 Preston, until we crest the top of the hill.&nbsp; We then continue DOWN Ewing  St. to Vestal Ave.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.&nbsp;</strong> Turning left, we follow Vestal  south until it makes a turn to the left at Avalon St. (street sign has Vestal  1900 N, Avalon 1700 W).&nbsp; In the middle of the turn, look to your right to  confront the Avalon-west Stairs -  125 steps.&nbsp; After climbing UP it and then the Avalon St. stub, we reach Lemoyne  St.<br>
<br>
<strong>5.&nbsp;</strong> Turning right, we follow Lemoyne  north until we see a slight jog to the right in Lemoyne.&nbsp; Looking to our left just  at the beginning of the jog, we see a narrow-paved road that descends the hill  (Ewing St.).&nbsp; The address on the small older house across the street at this  point is 1958 Lemoyne.&nbsp; Carefully descend this steep road which eventually turns  to dirt and which literally dumps us onto Lake Shore Ave.&nbsp; An Ewing St. stub continues  again across Lemoyne leading us to the Ewing-west Stairs of 128 steps which takes us UP to N. Alvarado St.<br>
<br>
<strong>6.&nbsp;</strong> Here, we turn right and walk  north on Alvarado one short block to Fargo St.&nbsp; Fargo happens to be the 3rd  steepest street in Los Angeles (28th St. in San Pedro is the steepest, and a  road on Mt. Washington is second).&nbsp; Because of the steepness, the sidewalk on  Fargo St. is occasionally interrupted by stairs - the Fargo Stairs - 17 steps in total.&nbsp; Carefully negotiate down this  steep street, looking from side to side to see how people have adopted their  homes and driveways to living on such a steep street.&nbsp; At the bottom of Fargo is  Allesandro St.&nbsp; The depression seen beyond Allesandro St., now containing the  Glendale Freeway (2), used to be one of the routes of the old Red Car lines.<br>
<br>
<strong>7.&nbsp;</strong> We turn right on Allesandro St.  and proceed north past Baxter St. to a short cul-du-sac named Cove St.  Beyond the end of the cul-du-sac is our last stairway, the Cove St. Stairs - 198 steps which brings us back up to N. Alvarado. &nbsp; Going up these stairs helps you to again appreciate what hill-side/stairway  living must be like (imagine having to deliver a refrigerator to one of these  houses).&nbsp; Turning right, we follow N. Alvarado south past Cerro Gordo (coming  in from the left) to Baxter St.<br>
<br>
<strong>8.&nbsp;</strong> Turning left, we follow Baxter  St. back to our cars.&nbsp; This will require going downhill from Alvarado, then up  and over the next hill to reach the school, not an easy stroll. <br>
<br>
Refreshments will be served at the  picnic tables located at the north end of Echo Park.&nbsp; Backtrack south down Echo  Park Ave., then turn right on Park St. and park along the street.<br>
<br>
While at the park, be sure and  notice the big white building on the NE corner of Glendale Blvd. and Park St. &nbsp; This is the Angeles Temple, home of Aimee Semple McPherson&rsquo;s International  Church of the Foursquare Gospel.&nbsp; Be sure and take an after-hike stroll around  the park.<br>
<br>
<strong>Getting Home:</strong> 101 Freeway on-ramps  are available going north and south off of Glendale Blvd.&nbsp; Exit the park by  driving west on Park St., then turn left on Glendale Blvd., and follow the big  green signs.<br>
