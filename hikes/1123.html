<center><h3><b>Backbone West, Hondo Canyon to Saddle Peak</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 10 miles RT<br> 
Elevation gain: 2000 ft.</p>

<p>Note: This hike is a shorter version of Hike #831 which starts from Dead Horse trailhead off of Entrada Road.</p>
 
<p>Directions to Trailhead: From the valley, exit Ventura Freeway 101 at Topanga Canyon Blvd and drive south approximately 8.0 miles to Old Topanga Road, turn right. From the Pacific Coast Highway, drive north on Topanga Canyon Blvd approximately 4.3 miles to Old Topanga Road, turn left.</p>

<p>Follow Old Topanga Road north approximately 0.4 miles to the Backbone trailhead to Hondo Canyon, it will be on your left, parking is just beyond, also on your left.</p>

<p>The Hike: Proceed over the creek near the Topanga trailhead and steadily up through beautifully shaded olive oaks and a sloping green meadow.  Before long you will come to Hondo Canyon, a wonderful pink gorge speckled with wild flowers in the Spring. You will begin switch-backing up the steep south slope of the canyon thru a lovely oak forest and then a deep chaparral forest, eventually coming to a choice, go left, on to Saddle Peak Road or continue on the trail passing below an abandoned radio relay tower and on across an intersection of Stunt, Schueren and Saddle Peak roads. Climb the hill ahead by passing to the left of a large white water tank, and continue eventually reaching the top of Saddleback Mountain. Return the way you came.</p>

<p>Those preferring a shorter hike can opt for Saddle Peak Road. Rest and relax, eat your lunch, enjoy the spectacular views and the birds. Smell the flowers too, then return the way you came.</p>
 
<p>Refreshments will be served at the trailhead.</p>
