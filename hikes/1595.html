<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> Take the 210 Freeway east and exit on Santa Anita Ave. in Arcadia.&nbsp; Head north on Santa Anita Ave. which eventually turns into Chantry Flat Road.&nbsp; Drive to  Chantry Flat in about 5-6 miles. &nbsp; Park in the upper large lot. &nbsp; Signed trailhead is across the road.&nbsp; Don't forget Forestry parking pass.
<p><strong>Hike Options:&nbsp;</strong> <font color="#ff0000"><strong>This will be the first hike at Chantry Flat after a four-year closure following the 2020 Bobcat fire</strong>.</font> There are many hike choices from this trailhead:</p>

<p><strong>Option 1:&nbsp;</strong> It could be an out and back to one of the camps along Gabrielino Trail and return. &nbsp; Example: Return from Spruce Grove = 7 miles round trip.&nbsp; Or, turn around sooner.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Option 2:</strong>&nbsp; It could be a longer loop trip up to Sturdevant Campground then onto Mount Zion and return via Upper or Lower Winter Creek trails, 8-9 miles.<br>
<br>
<strong>Option 3:</strong>&nbsp; It could be a shorter loop from Roberts Camp along Lower Winter Creek to Hoegees and return via Upper Winter Creek. 5.1 miles<br>
<br>
<strong>Option 4:&nbsp;</strong> It could be a long out and back on the Santa Anita Ridge Trail (7-8 miles), or even a longer 9 mile trek extending from the ridge along the Olene Ridge and back via Upper Winter Creek.<br>
<br>
<strong>Option 5:&nbsp;</strong> Or it could be a shorter descent to Hermit Falls starting from the "First Water" trail turnoff, 3 miles.</p>

<p>Weather and altitude thoughts: Chantry = 2,220 feet,  Mt. Zion = 3,575 feet,  Spruce Grove = 3,100 feet,
Hoegees = 2,500 feet,  Sturtevant = 3,240 feet.  Hopefully all below snow level, but wouldn’t it be nice to see some?
