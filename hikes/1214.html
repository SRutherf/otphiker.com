February 25, 2015<br>
Echo Mountain & Inspiration Point via Sam Merrill Trail</p>

From the 110:  Make your way to the 210 Freeway and follow the directions above, or continue on the 110 as it morphs into Arroyo Parkway and turn right on California Blvd.  Go east approximately 1 mile to its intersection with Lake Ave. Turn left at Lake and go north approximately 5 miles to the end of the street a Loma Alta Dr.</p>

<p><b>Hike Description(s):</b> Both hikes start at the same trailhead.  After hiking a relatively steep 2.6 miles you reach a trail junction.
