<p><strong>Hike #1344<br>
Red Box to Strawberry Peak/Springs<br>
November 29, 2017</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Jim Gardner</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arrive at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.&nbsp; This will avoid the inconvenience and save costs to the hike leader.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
Redbox to the peak = 7.1 mi.; Max Elevation change = 1,510 ft.<br>
Redbox to the spring = 6.8 mi.; Max Elevation change = 610 ft.<br>

<p><strong>Trailhead Directions:&nbsp;</strong> Meet at Red Box Station at mileage paddle 38.38 on the Angeles Crest Highway (about 14 miles from I-210 at the Mt. Wilson road turn off).&nbsp; There are restrooms at Red Box.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong>&nbsp; Strawberry Peak's 6,164 foot summit beats San Gabriel Peak's 6,161 foot to claim the honor of being the highest peak in the Front Range.&nbsp; Although its profile appears rounded as seen from most places, its flanks fall away sharply on three sides, leaving only one relatively easy route to the top (our route).</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> From Red Box we cross the highway and walk east along the left shoulder of Angeles Crest Highway to a fireroad slanting left up the hillside.&nbsp; We continue up the eroded bed of the road for 0.6 miles to reach a trail on the left. From there the trail switchbacks up to a saddle due south of Mount Lawlor's summit, and from there on uphill to the saddle on the northwest shoulder of Mount Lawlor.&nbsp; At this point we have climbed almost 600 ft. and hiked approximately 2.3 miles.</p>

<p>Those who want to climb the peak take off on a trail to the left and climb approximately 900 ft. over the steep and rocky 1 mile route to the peak.</p>

<p>Those who want to go to Strawberry Springs continue on the same trail we used to get to the Saddle for approx. 1 mile.&nbsp; The trail drops down approximately 400 feet from the saddle to the spring.</p>

<p>Refreshments will be served at Red Box.</p>
