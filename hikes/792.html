<p>Distance to Emma Copper Mine: 1.3 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain: About 640 ft.<br>
Distance on PCT: 6 miles round trip (or more)<br>
Elevation gain: About 1325 ft.</p>

<p>Summary: We first visit some mine sites, then drive to a trailhead on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and hike to the south about 3 miles. The trail continues another 11 miles to Messenger Flats if one wants more mileage. Please bring flashlights and protective head gear if you plan on entering any of the mines.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead #1: North on Highway SR-14 to Soledad Canyon Road.  Take the east exit on the first Soledad Canyon Road about 11 miles to mileage paddle 21.05 to a dirt road headed north toward Parker Mountain.  At that point drive north several hundred feet on an unmarked dirt road and park.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead #2:  Drive back west on Soledad Canyon Road to mileage paddle 17.56 and park in parking lot on north side of road.

<p>Hike #1: We walk 0.6 miles to the prominent mine opening named The Emma, a walk in mine.  It was first mined for copper around 1900 and occasionally worked since that time.  It has one passage, which goes 312 feet.  Presumably it is named after Mt. Emma, a few miles to the east.  The mine is unsealed.  A flashlight is needed to see in the mine and it is spooky inside.  There are other mines nearby to observe, but not to go in.</p>

<p>Hike #2: We head south on the Pacific Crest trail for 3.1 miles to an arbitrary turn around point, and return the way we came.  </p>

<p>Refreshments will be served at the second trailhead parking lot.</p>

<p>History: Mining in Soledad Canyon, much of which is now part of Acton, began in 1861.  In 1869 George Gleason, a local miner built a road up the nearby high mountain which was later named after him.  He harvested timber.  On its north slope, he found gold-bearing quartz veins.  Soon many other mines were dug and were worked on and off until the early 1930s. The Mt. Gleason Mine is the only significant tunnel remaining.</p>
