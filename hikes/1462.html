<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.&nbsp; This will save the hike leader the inconvenience and cost of providing descriptions/maps to you all.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>&nbsp; Take the 5  South (from the Valley and from north O.C.) or the 405 South (from the coast  cities) past the &quot;Y&quot; junction where the 5 and 405 merge.&nbsp; Exit the 5  at El Toro Road, turn right on El Toro for about 1 mile to Moulton Parkway,  turn left on Moulton and go about 1 mile to Glenwood Drive, turn right on  Glenwood (which will become Pacific Park Drive) for about 1.5 miles, turn right  on Canyon Vistas.&nbsp; Go about 1/2 mile until it reaches its end at Silkwood. Park  by the corner here at Canyon View Park, where we will gather for the hike.&nbsp; Parking  is in the streets of the neighborhood and there is no parking fee.&nbsp; The  Wilderness Park is accessed through the city park.<br>
  <br>
A somewhat shorter route if you wish to pay the toll is to take the 73S toll  road from the 405, exit on Glenwood Drive / Pacific Park, turn right on Pacific  Park and shortly turn right on Canyon Vistas.&nbsp; Follow the directions above to  drive to the bottom of the hill and park on the street.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Hike: </strong>&nbsp; We will start from, and return to, Canyon View Park, which has one  upgraded port-a-potty and three picnic tables.&nbsp; There are occasional  port-a-potties along the hike.&nbsp; The trailhead is reached by walking through the  park to the rear right corner to a gate into the Wilderness Park.&nbsp; Excellent  signage exists along the trails in the Wilderness Park.&nbsp; All hikes begin by  walking through the city park to the entrance.&nbsp; After walking in the Wilderness  Park a short distance we come to a bench and poster board, and a fork in the  trail.<br>
<br>
The  <strong>baseline hike</strong> this time is a counterclockwise loop starting at the  turnoff to the right on Cholla Trail, which we reach after we head south a  short distance from the park.&nbsp; We take Cholla a few hundred feet uphill to the  ridge of the hills and turn left (south) on West Ridge Trail.&nbsp; We hike West  Ridge Trail&nbsp; past the Rock-it Trail (on the left) until the intersection  with Mathis Canyon Trail.&nbsp; The loop to this point is about 1.8 miles.&nbsp; We turn  left to go downhill (moderately steeply) southeast  until Wood Canyon Trail.&nbsp; We turn right on this trail, and walk (about 0.5  miles) to the marked very short trail to Dripping Cave.&nbsp; This is a nice spot for  lunch.&nbsp; We then continue back to the Wood Canyon Trail (our main trail).&nbsp; This  gets us to about 4.0 miles on the loop.&nbsp; The baseline  hike now turns left (north) following Wood Canyon Trail along Wood Creek, with  shade, trees, creek, and meadow scenery, all the way back to Canyon View Park  and the trailhead. <br>
<br>
Several  excellent <strong>hike alternatives</strong> exist here and will be explained, with a map, at  the start of the hike.<br>
<br>
<strong>One  nice short extension</strong> is (1) about 0.3 mile further down (south) from  Dripping cave to Cave Rock (and then return) or (2) continue a little further  until we reach the end of this trail at Aliso Creek Trail, which is about 3.5  miles back to the trailhead. <br>
<br>
<strong>Other hike extensions</strong> include (1) a half mile walk each way to Top of  the World (for a panoramic view of Catalina, Palos Verdes, the San Gabriels,  and San Clemente Island) by continuing on West Ridge Trail past the Mathis  Trail turnoff, (2) up to 1.75 miles each way by walking along Aliso Creek Trail  or possibly Meadows Trail at the end of Wood Canyon Trail, and (3) various  little trail options along the way.&nbsp; Some of us like to hike the baseline hike  in the opposite direction.<br>

  A Side Trip extension</strong> courtesy of Tom K: (Follow these  instructions if you want a little excitement in your life.)<br>
As you&nbsp;descend down Mathis Canyon Trail a short distance you  will see a sign on your right for Car Wreck Trail. &nbsp; This trail  is very steep and those w/ knee issues should avoid this.&nbsp; Car Wreck  will take you down to the canyon floor in a much shorter distance than Mathis  Canyon Trail.&nbsp; However, once near the bottom you will be rewarded with a  sight not often seen; A 1940's auto of&nbsp;undetermined make  or&nbsp;model&nbsp;embedded in the&nbsp;ground. &nbsp;How it got there no one  seems to know. &nbsp;After viewing the car, continue east. You will soon  connect with the Oak Grove Trail (a very scenic area). Oak Grove  will then&nbsp;connect with Dripping Cave Trail. Then follow the  main instructions to return to the trailhead.<br>
<br>
<strong>Two suggested shorter  hikes</strong> are (1) Go down Wood Canyon Trail to Dripping Cave and return (4.7  miles without much elevation gain, and in pretty, shaded scenery) and (2) a  full 5 mile loop but that turns onto Mathis Canyon Trail and Wood Canyon Trail  without side trips and without going all the way to Aliso Creek Trail .<br>
<br>
BYO refreshments will be in the city park.&nbsp; Glass bottles and alcohol are  prohibited, so all beverages shouldl be in cans or plastic bottles.<br>
