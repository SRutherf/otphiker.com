<p><b>Directions to Trailhead:</b> &nbsp;From the 101 freeway travelling west, take the Lynn Road exit in Thousand Oaks. Turn right (north) and go 2.5 miles. Turn left (west) on Avenida de los Arboles. Look for the sign for Wildwood Park. Drive 0.9 miles to the end of the street and do a U-turn. The large parking lot is on the right.  Parking is free. There are no restrooms at this trailhead but there are restrooms 0.3 miles back the way you came at the intersection of Velarde Drive and Avenida de los Arboles.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:</strong> There are two main loops that can be taken in Wildwood Park. Each is a little over 4 miles and 700 feet elevation gain.&nbsp; They can be done separately or together, in either direction.</p>
<p><strong>Wildwood Park Lizard Rock Trail:</strong>&nbsp;Head west out of the parking lot along the Mesa Trail fire road.&nbsp;Turn left either on the public access road at 0.25 miles or the North Tepee Trail at 0.4 miles.&nbsp;The trails lead to an indian cave, picnic areas, Paradise Falls, and a tepee.&nbsp; Head west on the Wildwood Canyon Trail past the stinky Hill Canyon Wastewater Treatment Plant and eventually to Lizard Rock.&nbsp; Head back to the trailhead by the Mesa Trail.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Rosa / Lower Butte Trails:</strong> Head west out of the parking lot along the Mesa Trail fire road. After 0.3 miles turn right onto the Santa Rosa Trail.&nbsp;The trail starts a slow climb towards the Mount Clef Ridge. After about 0.2 miles the trail heads right along the foothills, though dense patches of cacti, then turns left and begins a series of switchbacks that enentually reach the top of the ridgeline.&nbsp; From the top, one has good views of Thousand Oaks to the south and the Santa Rosa Valley to the north. Heading down and to the east, one skirts to the north of residential neighborhoods. At about 2.4 miles, the trail turns south-east, passing close to homes, and becomes the Lower Butte Trail. The trail continues up and over a shoulder, eventually reaching a residential street, Hill Canyon Ave. From here, the hike becomes less interesting and finishes witht a 1-mile walk through residential streets.&nbsp; Head south on Hill Canyon Ave., turn right on Big Sky Drive to return to the trailhead.&nbsp; Otherwise choose alternate routes.<br>
