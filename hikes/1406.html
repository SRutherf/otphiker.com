  <strong>Naples History and  Neighborhood: </strong><br>
  <br>
  This hike is on flat, paved walkways.&nbsp; There is no shade, but it has a great variety  of architecture of private homes and beautiful gardens along the canals.&nbsp; Most walks are next to water, beach or canal,  with many boats to admire.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  The idea began in 1904 when the father-and-son team, Arthur  Parsons, announced plans for a &quot;Venetian-style&quot; community that  featured a series of canals and pedestrian walkways.&nbsp; To accomplish this, they enclosed, dredged,  filled in, and stabilized a marshland with concrete bulkheads to create the  seaside neighborhood.&nbsp; The first 6 houses  were built as speculative homes.&nbsp;  Waterfront lots in Naples ranged from $900 to $4,000, which was costly  at the time.&nbsp; In 1907, the Parsons  partnered with oil-and rail baron Henry Huntington, to incorporate a stop at  Naples on the Pacific Electric Railroad's Newport Line. <br>
  <br>
  If you want to spend more time in the area, the art museum  or a stroll on 2nd St with many shops and restaurants are interesting. There is  also the MOLAA (Museum of Latin American Art) just down the street on Alamitos  Ave.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  In the middle of the island off E. The Toledo and circled by  Ravenna Dr. is a little park, which would be a nice place for a cookie  break on the outgoing trip and lunch on the return trip. <br>
