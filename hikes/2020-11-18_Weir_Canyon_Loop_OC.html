7.5 miles RT. 1,300 feet elevation gain.</p>

<p><b>Directions to Trailhead:</b> &nbsp;Exit the 91 freeway at Weir Canyon south. Continue to Running  Springs Drive and turn right into the Ronald Reagan Park.&nbsp;  Park at the west side of the parking lot.</p>
<p><b>The Hike:</b>&nbsp; The red dashed circle at the start of the hike represents a  walking path within the park.&nbsp; Follow the dashed trails on the map south in the  direction indicated by arrows drawn on the map.&nbsp; Shortly after you make the left  turn after you leave the park you will pass through a tunnel.&nbsp; Continue south  and follow the arrows around the loop.&nbsp; If you do the whole loop the distance is  7.5 miles, 1300 ft elevation gain.</p>
There are two short-cut trails that cut off part of  the loop for a shorter hike.&nbsp; The second one is steep and difficult to locate.&nbsp; If  you do the loop all the way to the end, be sure to watch for the confusing  trail signs.&nbsp; For an even shorter hike, turn around sooner.
