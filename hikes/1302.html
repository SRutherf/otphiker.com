<p>Hike #1302<br>
December 7, 2016<br>
Charlton Flat to Vetter Mt. Lookout - a Different Way</p>

<p>Alice Weiss, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data: None yet.</p>

<p>Introduction: This is a new hike. There are no dead trees to climb over and it is a beautiful area. Mike and I checked this out by accident during Norm's hike last month. Maps will be provided before the hike.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Drive up Angeles Crest Highway to mileage paddle 47.54 (24 miles from La Canada) to the Charlton Flat picnic area. Turn left into the area and watch for the first road on the right which will lead you to the parking area.</p>

<p>The Hike: The hike begins just past this area.</p>
