<center><h3><b>Rocky Peak via the Hummingbird Trail</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 7 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1550 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 118 freeway west-bound, exit at Kuehner Dr., turn north and park immediately on either side of Kuehner Dr.</p>

<p>The Hike: We start on the Hummingbird trail climbing east up toward the Simi Hills, and paralleling the 118 freeway below and to our right. After about 2.5 miles of steady climb over the sandstone rocks we turn left onto the Rocky Peak fire road. we turn left and climb up to the Rocky Peak cutoff.</p> 

<p>The old approach to the peak began as a road, followed by a scramble up to the peak. Recently, this approach is seriously overgrown which may require proceeding 0.45 mi further on Rocky Peak road and then looking for a use trail that leads off to the right over and around a small peak (West Peak) <a href="../aerialphotomaps/RockyPeakDetail.jpg">See Detail of Rocky Peak Access Trail</a>. Only after getting around West Peak can Rocky Peak be seen. Continue on the trail down to a saddle between the two peaks, then scramble up the rocks to the peak. We return to the trailhead the way we came.</p>

<p><b>Caution:</b> The "connector trail" shown in the photo connecting the Hummingbird Trailhead to the Chumash Trailhead resulted from a hike exploring a loop hike combining the two trails. Recent construction in this area may preclude hiking this path.</p>
