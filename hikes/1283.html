<p>Hike #1283<br>
<b>Baden Powell from Dawson Saddle</b><br>
July 20, 2016</p>

<p>Rich Frederick, Hike Leader</p>

<p>Round trip mileage approximately 9 miles<br>
Elevation gain approximately 2400 feet.</p>

<p><b>Trailhead:</b> Dawson Saddle is at mileage paddle 69.59 (however the last mileage paddle is at 69.00), 45.2 miles from 210 freeway turnoff (a little more than 1 hour driving time). Parking is on the North side of Angeles Crest Highway.</p>

<p><b>Hike Details:</b> Starts at approximately 7900 feet elevation. You take Dawson Saddle Trail approximately 1.8 miles to its intersection with the PCT (approximately 8800 feet elevation). This first stretch is through a pine and fir forest. Turn left (NE) at the intersection and go 2.5 miles on the PCT to the summit of Baden-Powell (the last part is a rather steep few hundred feet to the top of the 9399 foot peak). Lunch at the top and return the same way.</p>

<p><b>Variations on the standard hike:</b> Throop Peak (9138 feet elevation) is near the intersection of the Dawson Saddle and PCT trails. This can be an added 350 feet climb either on the way up or back for the ambitious or a final destination for those desiring a shorter hike (this would make an approx. 4.5 mile round trip, 1300 feet elevation gain hike). Those wanting a short hike but not wanting to climb Throop could just turn right at the PCT junction and walk a little distance on a relatively flat part of the PCT, eat lunch at a convenient place and return the way they came.</p>

<p><b>Like to start early?</b> Not exactly very organized but definitely approved by the leader since it is a relatively long hike at high altitude and which is more enjoyable if you can sort of pick your own pace. Hikers have started 1 hour earlier than scheduled time and people who arrived later pretty much started as soon as they were ready. One request, though. If you leave before I get there, please <u>leave a note under your windshield wiper</u> letting me know who has started. Thanks.
