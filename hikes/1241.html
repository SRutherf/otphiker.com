<p>Hike #1241<br>
September 2, 2015<br>
Catalina Island</p>

<p>Rich Frederick, Hike Leader</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: I have opted for the San Pedro Catalina Express Terminal. It's the one we've used in the past, and it's convenient. Take 110 Harbor Freeway south to route 47 exit. On exiting stay to the right and DO NOT GO LEFT ONTO THE BRIDGE! To the right and downward you will hit N. Harbor Blvd. Go straight across into Swinford St which leads directly into the parking lot. The terminal is at the far end of the lot. There is an hourly rate for parking.</p>

<p>Each hiker must make their own individual reservations. Go to Catalina Express on the internet or call 1 800 481-3470. Reserve the <b>08:30 AM</b> departure to stay with the group and the <b>5:15 PM</b> return. Times could change, but stay with these approximate times if they do. Round trip is $74.50 (seniors $68). These could also change. The trip over takes an hour.</p>

<p>The hike: There are at least two variants. Heading southwest out of town on Avalon Cyn Rd. for about 3/4 mile we come to the Hermit Gulch campground. From there we head west and up, intersecting above with the extension of Avalon Cyn. Rd., heading south and then east to the Wrigley Memorial and then northeast back into town on the road. The loop totals about 7 miles and 1500 ft elevation gain. Toward the top there is a side trail southwest 1/2 mile to the lone tree, which is actually clearly identifiable. This would add a mile to the hike's total.</p>

<p>A less challenging hike passes by the campground on the way out and goes directly to the memorial (and a wonderful cactus botanical garden) or about 1.2 miles. From there a trail runs up to an intersection 1.2 miles and about 1000 ft gain away. This hike is the return portion of the longer hike above. RT just under 5 miles.</p> 

<p>Finally, when one reaches the intersection at the top of the short hike, one could turn east instead of returning back down and then complete a loop to Avalon amounting to between 9 and 10 miles. I have never done that hike, and I have not checked it out.</p>

<p>I will provide cookies. However, that's the extent of the largesse. After the hike we will convene at Antonio's Pizzeria, the last restaurant on the waterfront toward the casino. Everyone is on their own at that point.</p>
