<p><strong>Summary: </strong>&nbsp; “New Millennium Loop Trail” is a new designation for an improved loop consisting of parts of the Juan Bautista de Anza Trail, the old Gun Club Road, and some improved old trails. &nbsp;The Juan Bautista de Anza trail is part of the original Camino Real or King's Road. &nbsp;The hike consists of a basic loop plus an an additional loop extending beyond the basic loop. &nbsp;A series of switchbacks leading off the extended loop is available to add mileage as an option.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>&nbsp; Head west on the Ventura (101) freeway out of Woodland Hills and exit on Las Virgenes Road. Turn left (south) over the freeway.&nbsp;Enter Cambria Hotel Calabasas in GPS apps.</p>
<p><strong>Trailhead Changes:&nbsp; </strong>The trailhead is where it has always been, the difference is that  there is a hotel there now.&nbsp;About 0.1 mile south of the freeway turn left into the driveway of the new <a href="../images/1519_description/cambria_hotel.jpg">Cambria Hotel</a>. Drive to the far end of the hotel parking lot following the <a href="../images/1519_description/signs.jpg">trailhead signs</a> to the <a href="../images/1519_description/trailhead.jpg">trailhead</a>. The upper part of the hotel  parking lot has five parking spaces identified as <a href="../images/1519_description/parking_area.jpg">trailhead parking only</a>.  &nbsp;The hotel parking lot is large and the hotel desk staff confirmed that additional hiker's cars could use other spare parking spaces. At the trailhead there is  also a <a href="../images/1519_description/restroom_sign.jpg">sign</a> that indicates that hikers may use the hotel's restrooms. The hotel desk staff also confirmed that this was correct, though requested that hikers remove hiking boots if muddy. Restrooms are located past the desk on the right. </p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> The hike begins straight up the canyon to a junction where the slope levels for a saddle. After descending from the saddle and approaching the  freeway, avoid the brush and early crossing of the stream. &nbsp;Following the  improved trail away from the freeway will return us, and soon result in a later  easier stream crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will hike the loop clockwise, so stay left at the junction and trail sign. &nbsp;We are on the De Anza trail and soon traversing high above the freeway before dropping down to, and crossing a small steam bed. &nbsp; Hike along the trail/dirt road parallel to the freeway and under the power lines, to the “East Trailhead”, where the paved Calabasas Road ends, and is blocked by an elaborate steel gate. &nbsp;After another 100 yards, you will get you to a small paved stub off to the right that will eventually drop down to the creek. &nbsp;Come up out of the creek and turn right at the trail sign.</p> 

<p>The trail climbs on the western slope, above the canyon, toward the distant houses on the crest. &nbsp;After a hard mile upward you will crest and there will be two small “trail” signs. &nbsp;Continue to a paved road parallelling the houses above, then turn right, and then continue for most of a mile on the old dirt road. &nbsp;At the signed junction stay on the road for the shorter loop, or turn left on the trail for the extended loop.</p>

<p><strong>Basic loop:</strong>&nbsp; Stay on the road until a second hairpin turn, when a small trail sign directs you to a trail on the right.  Continue north on the trail to reach the hike’s first junction, the bench, and ultimately the trailhead.</p>

<p><strong>Extension 1:&nbsp;</strong> The trail contours eastward and then westward down a wooded draw eventually reaching a small connector trail that branches off to the right down some railroad tie stairs soon reaching a dirt road. &nbsp;Turn right on the road and continue north-westerly up the road to the hairpin turn, where a small trail sign directs you northward on the trail back to the bench’s junction. &nbsp;Turn left and return to the trailhead.</p>

<p><strong>Extension 2:&nbsp;</strong> To extend the hike beyond the extended loop, instead of turning right to take the connector trail back to the road, climb southward up the switchbacks and proceed toward the Bark Park Trailhead, as far as you wish. &nbsp;Return the way you came using the small connector road to complete the extended loop as per above.</p>
<p><strong>Extension&nbsp;3:</strong>&nbsp; The helicopter with Kobe  Bryant and others went down on 1/26/2020. The location is essentially on the  Bark Park trail just below its junction with the trail that continues  traversing southward along the hillside. (See the map.) &nbsp;In the summer of  2021 there was no official memorial, but quite a collection of Laker  memorabilia, small crosses, boxes with notes, vases with dried flowers, and  rock outlines with his jersey number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BYO refreshments and beach chairs&nbsp;as there are no benches at the trailhead.</p>
