<p>Echo Mountain: Approximately 6 miles RT, elevation gain approx. 1400 feet.<br>
Inspiration Point: Approximately 10 miles RT, elevation gain approx. 2800 feet.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions:  The trailhead is roughly at the intersection of Lake Ave and Loma Alta Dr. in Altadena.  Parking is along the curb on either street</p>

<p>From the 210: Take the Lake exit and go north approx. 3.5 miles to the end of the street at Loma Alta Dr.<br>
From the 110:  Make your way to the 210 Freeway and follow the directions above, or continue on the 110 as it morphs into Arroyo Parkway and turn right on California Blvd.  Go east approximately 1 mile to its intersection with Lake Ave. Turn left at Lake and go north approximately 5 miles to the end of the street a Loma Alta Dr.</p>

<p>Hike description(s):  Both hikes start at the same trailhead.  After hiking a relatively steep 2.6 miles you reach a trail junction.  The "short" hikers will take the short stub trail to Echo Mountain. There are lots of interesting sights at the former hotel site.  Return is via the the same route.</p>

<p>The "long" hikers will take the (upper) Sam Merrill trail to the north about 2.7 miles to Inspiration Point. The view from Inspiration Point is often good (but not usually inspiring).  Return is via the same route.</p>

<p>Refreshments will be a park a short distance South on Lake Ave.
