<p>Distance: 8 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1240 ft.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: From the east, on the 210 freeway (westbound) take the Lowell Avenue off ramp.  You will be westbound on Honolulu Avenue, turn right (north) on Tujunga Canyon Blvd. At Foothill Blvd turn left (west), continue to Mt. Gleason Avenue and turn right (north).  Drive north on Mt. Gleason Avenue; turn right on Big Tujunga Canyon Road.  About two miles beyond the Angeles National Forest sign is the Upper Trail Canyon Road, marked by a sign on the right side of the road, mile paddle 2.05.  Turn left and drive 1/2 mile up the dirt road to the parking area in Trail Canyon.  Be not dismayed at the road into Trail Canyon, it is steep just at the beginning and a bit narrow all the way, but it is negotiable by passenger cars.</p>

<p>From the west, on the 210 freeway (eastbound) take the Sunland Blvd. off ramp.  Continue straight and you will find yourself on Foothill Blvd.  Turn left (north) on Mt. Gleason Avenue and follow the instructions above.</p>

<p>The Hike: We walk past the gate and follow an old road that passes some cabins, crosses the stream, and then climbs up then drops back into the canyon and ends. We pick up the trail across the creek, and continue up-canyon by following (and boulder bounding) the stream. About a mile in, the trail leaves the creek bed to climb over the Trail Canyon Falls, then drops back into the canyon to continue our trek up stream for the next 2 miles. At this point, we reach the old Tom Lucas campground which is no longer maintained by the Forest Service, then after another mile, we reach the new Tom Lucas Campground - our destination.</p>

<p>After eating our lunch, we return to the trailhead by the way we came. Be sure an look for the abandoned wheelbarrow rusting away along the trail, and wonder with the rest of us why it is there.  Refreshments at the trailhead.</p>
