<strong>Directions  to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong>  From the south, take I-605 and exit at Whittier Blvd. (south).&nbsp; Go 1.1 miles southeast on  Whittier Blvd to Hadley and turn left.&nbsp; Go 0.9 mile to Greenleaf and turn  left.&nbsp; Go 0.6 mile on Greenleaf to 5700 Greenleaf, just past Orange  St.&nbsp; The entrance to the Hellman Park parking lot is on the right.&nbsp; From the north, take I-605 and exit at Beverly Blvd. (east).&nbsp; Go 2.1 miles on Beverly Blvd., then turn left on Greenleaf Ave.&nbsp; The Hellman Park Trailhead is 0.1 miles on the right.</p>
<p><strong>Parking:&nbsp;</strong> Gates to the park and parking lot open a little before 9:00 am.&nbsp; There will likely be a line of cars waiting for the small number of spaces in the lot (approx. 20) which will quickly fill up.&nbsp; There is no parking on Greeleaf north of the park entrance.&nbsp; Street parking in the immediate vicinity and south of the trailhead is by permit only.&nbsp; This includes south on Greenleaf for 2.5 blocks down to Broadway, and east and west on Orange Drive.&nbsp; Essentially, the only available street parking within a reasonable distance from the trailhead is east and west on Beverly Blvd. &nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Amenities:</strong>&nbsp; There is a big portable toilet at the trailhead.&nbsp; There are no picnic tables or chairs so please bring chairs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Basic  Hike:&nbsp;</strong> Hellman Park enables  one to access the entire 4,000 acres of the Native Habitat Preservation  Authority&rsquo;s lands extending from Whittier on the west to Powder Canyon on the  southeast in Hacienda Heights.&nbsp; Since the Hellman Park Trail has been  fenced off, take the Mariposa Trail, which goes steeply northeast.&nbsp;When  you come to a split, you can continue on the Mariposa Trail to the left or go  right onto the Peppergrass Trail.&nbsp; The Mariposa trail is not as steep and ends  up rejoining the Peppergrass Trail further on. &nbsp; The Peppergrass Trail in 1.2 miles joins the  Rattlesnake Ridge Trail, where a LEFT  turn brings you in 0.9 miles, to a communications tower where you meet the fenced  off Hellman Park Trail.&nbsp; Turn around and go back the way you came on the  Rattlesnake Trail and the Peppergrass Trail. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Alternative  Hike #1:&nbsp;</strong> Take the Peppergrass  Trail, which goes steeply northeast.&nbsp; The Peppergrass Trail in 1.2  miles joins the Rattlesnake Ridge Trail.&nbsp; Go RIGHT at this  junction and go 0.2 mi. east on a level path to a junction with the Sumac Trail  where you turn right and go down 0.6 mi to an intersection with the Turnbull  Canyon Trail.&nbsp; Turn RIGHT and continue on  the Turnbull Canyon trail downhill for 0.7 miles until it ends upon reaching  Turnbull Canyon Road.&nbsp; Return to the trailhead the way you came.&nbsp; RT = 5.4  mile.&nbsp; Consider adding the Rattlesnake Trail extension to the communications tower  for an additional 1.8 miles RT, for an 7.2-mile total.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Alternate  Hike #2:&nbsp;</strong> Take the Peppergrass  Trail, which goes steeply northeast.&nbsp; The Peppergrass Trail in 1.2  miles joins the Rattlesnake Ridge Trail.&nbsp; Go RIGHT at this  junction and go 0.2 mi. east on a level path to a junction with the Sumac Trail  where we turn right and go down 0.6 mi to an intersection with the Turnbull  Canyon Trail.&nbsp; Turn LEFT onto the  Turnbull Canyon Trail, and in 0.6 mi. you will come to a junction with the  Schabarum Trail coming down from your left.&nbsp; Continue straight ahead east  on the Schabarum Trail, which in 0.4 mi crosses Turnbull Canyon Road and in a  few feet makes a sharp right turn.&nbsp; In 0.2 mi you will cross under the  Tehachapi Power Line and reach a road.&nbsp; Turn left on this road, part of  the Juan Bautista De Anza Trail Historic Route; pass a little knoll on your  left strewn with girder wreckage and in 0.5 mi come to a junction with the  Worsham Canyon Trail.&nbsp; This is a good turn around point.&nbsp; Go back the  way you came.<br>
  <br>
  Those wanting a shorter  hike could turn around at any place on the route.&nbsp; A stop for lunch would  be ideal anywhere in the shade of Turnbull Canyon.<br>
