<center><h3><b>Temescal Ridge Trail to Temescal Peak</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 5.6 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain: 700 ft.</p>

<p>Direction to Trailhead: From Pacific Coast Highway turn north onto Sunset Boulevard.  After 0.4 miles turn left on Palisades Drive.  This street winds uphill, eventually turning into Chastain Parkway East at the upper end.  After 3.9 miles from Sunset turn right onto Via Las Palmas.  This short street says it is Private, however, there is also a sign that points you up that street to Topanga State Park Temescal Ridge Trailhead, our objective.  At the end of this street is a driveway that continues up to a gated parking lot on the left. There is a restroom in the parking lot, however, it has been found to be closed  occasionally so plan accordingly.</p>

<p>The Hike: From the parking lot we walk up the concrete pathway that switchbacks up until it becomes a dirt trail connecting to the Temescal Ridge trail.  We turn left and continue about 2.6 miles until we get to the short, steep, trail to Temescal Peak at 2126 feet elevation.  The peak trail is about .1 miles before the junction of the Backbone Trail.  This will be the turn around and lunch stop, returning to the trailhead by retracing our steps.</p>

<p>For those wanting a longer hike, continue to the Hub and take the upper trail to Eagle Rock and lunch. After lunch, continue to Eagle Junction and down to Eagle Spring trail and back up to the Hub.  From there we retrace our route back to the cars. This will add 3.8 miles and another 600 ft. elevation gain.</p>
