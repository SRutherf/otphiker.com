<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:</strong> From the San Fernado Valley, exit Ventura Freeway 101 at Topanga Canyon Blvd. and drive south approximately 8.0 miles to Old Topanga Road, then turn right. From the Pacific Coast Highway, drive north on Topanga Canyon Blvd approximately 4.3 miles to Old Topanga Road, then turn left.&nbsp; Follow Old Topanga Road north approximately 0.4 miles, just past a small bridge over the creek, to the Hondo Canyon trailhead of the Backbone Trail. It will be on your left. Parking is just beyond, also on your left.&nbsp; If the parking space is full, there is a second parking area, on your left heading north, in 150 feet.&nbsp;Take care parking, as the road is narrow and twisting, thus hampering visibility. There are no restrooms. </p>

<p><strong>The Hike:</strong> Locate the trailhead at the southern end of the parking area next to a &quot;Horse Crossing&quot; sign.&nbsp; Proceed downhill and across the creek, then up a set of steps, past a sign saying, Topanga State Park.&nbsp; Proceed up through beautifully shaded olives and oaks and a sloping green meadow.  Before long you will come to Hondo Canyon, a wonderful pink/purple gorge speckled with wild flowers in the Spring. You will begin switch-backing up the steep south slope of the canyon thru a lovely oak forest and then a deep chaparral forest, eventually coming to a choice. Go left, onto Saddle Peak Road or continue on the Fossil Ridge trail passing below an abandoned radio relay tower.&nbsp; Both end up at the Lois Ewen Overlook (intersection of Stunt, Schueren and Saddle Peak roads), a good place for lunch. </p>
<p>From the Lois Ewen Overlook, you have three choices.</p>
<p><strong>Lois Ewen Overlook:  </strong>If you are tired, return to the Hondo trailhead. Otherwise for an additional ~2 miles RT, choose one the following options.</p>
<p><strong>Saddle Peak: </strong>Head west along Stunt Road for 500 feet, then turn left onto the Saddle Peak Rd. trail. Climb the hill ahead by passing to the left of a large white water tank. At 0.3 miles past the water tank, take the LEFT fork.&nbsp; Do NOT continue along the Backbone Trail on the right fork.&nbsp; Continue, eventually reaching the top of Saddle Peak adorned with radio towers. This is an additional 2.2 miles RT. Return the way you came.</p>
<p><strong>Topanga Lookout:</strong> Head east along the Topanga Tower Mtwy. Bypass the Radio Relay Tower on your right by taking the left fork. Continue until you reach the Topanga Lookout, heavily graffitied concrete foundations of a former fire lookout tower. Either climb up a short but steep rise to the top or take the trail to the right for a more gentle ascent.&nbsp; Once on top you are rewarded with stunning 360 degree views. This is an additional 2.0 miles RT.&nbsp; Return the way you came.</p>

<p>There are no picnic tables at the Hondo trailhead so bring your own chairs.</p>
