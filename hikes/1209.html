<p>Hike 1209<br>

<p>Las Llajas Canyon Hikes<p>

<p>Two hikes are possible, one towards Rocky Peak on the border between Los  Angeles and Ventura counties, and one up to the "steam shovel".

<p>About the shovel: It’s not a “steam” shovel at all since it has a gas engine. It is a 1905 P & H excavation shovel, abandoned on a ridge 1000 feet above the Llajas Canyon. One story says it was abandoned in 1920 when a sandstone quarry went bust. The most likely story is that it was abandoned in 1970.  It had been used to mine oyster shells for the chicken/egg industry (the shells used as feed to strengthen the egg shells). There are other mining industry relics in the area. Pick up about any rock and you will probably hold a fossil.</p>

<p>Directions to the trailhead: Take the 118 Reagan Freeway west to Simi Valley, CA. Exit the 118 on the second off ramp, Yosemite. Travel north 1.2 miles on Yosemite to Evening Sky Drive. Turn right on Evening Sky Drive for about 1/2 miles to the gated, paved  Llajas Canyon trail head on the left. NOTE: NO TOILET AT TRAIL HEAD. There is a McDonalds on the left side of Yosemite at the first intersection.</p>

<p><b>The Canyon Hike</b>(GPS data: 9.5 mi RT, max. elev. change 1230 ft): The trail follows a wide graded fire road along a seasonal stream on the canyon floor. We will be crossing the stream bed 3 times. At about 3.8 miles, a fork is reached - stay to the right where the trail soon leaves the stream bed and eventually rises to its highest elevation as the junction with the Rocky Peak Road is approached. This junction is the suggested turn-around point, however, hikers may choose to turn around at any time sooner. Do not turn left at the junction since this is the begining of private property. Return the way you came.</p>

<p><b>The Shovel Hike</b> (GPS Data: 7 mi RT, max. elev. change 1200 ft): Hike down Llajas Canyon for approximately 1.8 miles. Look for a large whiteish stone on the left of about one cubic yard in size. It may or may not have a stone duck on top of it. The trail up to the shovel begins behind this stone. Follow this trail up for about 1.5 miles and 1000 ft, passing the remnants of a crusher’s rollers, to a junction on the left. Here you are directly below the shovel. Take the trail on the left that doubles back and up for 0.2 miles to the shovel. At a wide-spot the trail doubles back to the right and up to the shovel This would be an interesting place for lunch. Return the way you came.</p>

<p>For the Rabbits: After returning to Llajas Canyon from the shovel, go left and continue the Canyon Hike as far as you want.</p>
