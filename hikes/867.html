<p>Directions to Trailhead: Go north on the I-5 then merge onto CA 2 towards Glendale.  At 0.1 mile take exit 14, San Fernando Road.  Turn left, then right on South Glendale Avenue.  At 0.1 mile, the road ends in the Forest Lawn Foundation Park.  Stop at the entrance kiosk for maps and illustrative brochures. Park in the large lot in front of the Forest Lawn Museum.  Restrooms are located throughout the park.</p>

<p>The Hike:</p>

NOTES:<br>
1) Be sure to view one of the hourly shows at the Hall of the Crucifixion. The Crucifixion by Polish artist Jan Styka is exhibited in a trilogy and explained.<br>
2) Be unobtrusive with snacks and lunch because no picnics are allowed. We will encounter funerals. Dress respectfully.</p>

<p>Proceed to Court of Freedom and Freedom Mausoleum where we view the resting places of movie stars. Once inside Freedom Mausoleum, turn right.  Stop at the first hall to the left of the Sanctuary of Heritage.  On the right wall (south) is a bust of Alan Ladd.  It is at the left of his tomb.  Nearby are Jeanette MacDonald, Nat King Cole, and George Burns with Gracie Allen and Clara Bow.  Dorothy Dandridge can be found at the opposite end of the mausoleum.</p>

<p>Outside the main entrance to the mausoleum on the right look for the statue of Little Mermaid in a corner of a small garden.  Walt Disney's ashes are behind it.  Walk west to the statue of Washington.  On the right is a door to the Garden of Everlasting Peace.  To the north of the statue are the graves of Errol Flynn and Spencer Tracy.</p>

<p>Proceed to the Acacia Garden and the stop designated Free Masons.  This Forest Lawn has the second highest number of remains of politicians in the state of California, exactly 35.  Amongst others are former House of Representative members, H. Allen Smith and Alphonzo Bell.</p>

<p>Stop also at Heron Fountain to look for birds and The Mystery of Life, a large statue that is an original by Ernest Gazzeri.</p>

<p>Although the art works in the park are known throughout the world, many are reproductions.  The Great Mausoleum is reminiscent of Westminster Abbey.  Inside are numerous reproductions of Michelangelo's works and the famous Last Supper window.  The later may be viewed both on the hour and half hour.</p>

<p>Other suggestions include Wee Kirk o' the Heather, a reproduction of Glencairn, Scotland where Annie Laurie worshipped.</p>
