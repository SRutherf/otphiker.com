<p>GPS Data:<br>
Ben Overturf Trail: Distance = 7 miles RT; max elevation gain = 1520 ft.<br>
Waterfall Trail: Distance = 2.4 mi RT; max elevation gain = 300 ft.</p>

<p>CAUTION: The trail takes hikers above and behind the Monrovia Police Department's Firing Range. The canyon trail is closed when they train, so a call to the department is advised before scheduling a hike [(626) 256-8000].

<p>Trailhead Directions: From the Foothill Freeway, I-210, in Monrovia, exit on Myrtle Avenue and proceed 2 miles north through Monrovia.  Go right toward the mountains. Turn right on Scenic Drive, jogging right, and around the bend jog left.  Keep a sharp eye out on this maneuver or if confused, check your cell phone (or Thomas Guide).</p>

<p>You should be heading north by this time and Scenic Drive becomes Canyon Blvd.  Continue another mile to the Monrovia Canyon Park entrance (1200 N. Canyon Blvd.).  There is an entry pay station.  We'll park here.</p>

<p>The Hike: Walk up Sawpit Canyon road toward the face of Sawpit Dam.  Steep and paved at first, it turns to dirt beyond the Trask Scout Reservation entrance, where you will continue, steadily ascending along the wall of Sawpit Canyon.  After a mile's climb, at a bend in the road, look left for two stone pillars and a sign for the Ben Overturf Trail.</p>

<p>The trail descends briefly to Sawpit Creek, crosses it then switchbacks uphill to Razorback.  As you cautiously cross Razorback, enjoy the great views down into the canyon.  The Ben Overturf Trail resumes climbing to the "Gap", a man made divide.</p>

<p>What appears to be some pagan object of worship turns out to be a pipe sticking out of "the Gap."  Opinions differ, but this is thought to be a pressure expansion pipe, part of an old water system which may still be used to bring water to Monrovia.</p>

<p>Past the Gap, the path is a pleasant, creek-side jaunt.  Overturf trail drops into Twin Springs Canyon, where a creek has sculpted what appears to be a natural bridge.  You'll soon pass a junction with a right-forking trail leading to Sawpit Canyon Road.  <u>Do not</u> take it.  Continue straight on the steep trail, cross a tributary of Sawpit Creek and you'll bear left on a spur trail to the Deer Park Lodge site (in ruins now).  You can return the same way or descend back to the trailhead via Sawpit Fire road, a faster (albeit less scenic) way to go.</p>

<p>Those who wish a shorter but very beautiful hike can take the Waterfall Trail. Start the hike by continuing up the road taking the first available left turn. Continue past the stub road to the picnic area and look for the self guided nature trail to the left. </p>

<p>Eventually we'll all meet at this picnic area for the discussion of why we do this and to enjoy refreshments.</p>
