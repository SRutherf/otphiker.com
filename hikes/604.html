<p>GPS Data<br>
Meadow Loop: 6.3 mi. RT (Shortcut reduces this by 0.3 mi.). Elevation gain: 7500 ft.<br>
Mugu Loop: 7.4 mi. RT (Peak bypass adds 0.6 mi. but reduces climb by 100 ft.). Elevation gain: 1200 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: La Jolla State Park is approximately 22 miles west of Malibu, 1 mile past the big sand dune.  Drive up La Jolla Canyon to the Ray Miller trailhead at the parking lot. There is a parking fee, and restrooms are available.</p>
 
<p>The Hike: We hike north up La Jolla Canyon to a junction with the La Jolla Valley Loop Trail. There are two loop options at this point:</p>

<p>Meadow Loop: Clockwise loop: Turn left and proceed on the LJ Valley Loop Trail past the junction with the Mugu Peak Trail (keep right), past the cross-meadow shortcut junction (keep left) up paralleling the old stream bed to the LJ Valley Fire Road (turn right) and proceed on the road to the campground for lunch. (You will pass deadend "T" junctions of the cross-meadow shortcut trail, and the start of the LJ Valley Loop trail on this segment - stay on the fire road). Return by hiking back on the road to the junction of the LJ Valley Loop Trail, turn left and proceed to and through the canyon to the trailhead. NOTE: Taking the cross-meadow shortcut trail will reduce the RT distance by 0.5 mile.</p>

<p>Mugu Loop: Proceed as above to the junction of the LJ Valley Loop and Mugu Peak trails and turn left making a long climb up and over the peak. Descend steeply on the north side of the peak and turn right at a junction with the Chumash Trail, an extension of the LJ Valley Fire Road. Proceed on the fire road to the campground and return to the trailhead as above. This loop can be lengthened by 0.5 mile by using the peak bypass trail swinging out west of the peak saving one the climb over the peak, or shortened by taking the LJ Valley Loop Trail or the cross-meadow shortcut trail back to the canyon junction.</p> 

<p>With clear weather we will have a beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean, Point Mugu, the Oxnard Plain and the Channel Islands.  Watch out for the Coreopsis bushes along the canyon wall. These ancient looking plants bear beautiful yellow flowers in the Spring. They can be seen only in the coastal canyons such as La Jolla.</p>
