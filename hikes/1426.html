<p>Option 3. Turn left at the Junction, go up to Josephine Peak  (2080 ft. total climb from trailhead) and return the way you came for 7.8 miles  RT.</p>
<p>Option 4. Same as 3 except continue past the Junction along  Josephine Saddle, then down the Colby Canyon trail to the highway at the Colby  Canyon trailhead, turn right and walk back to the trailhead for 8.9 miles RT.</p>
<p>There is one toilet at the Clear Creek ranger station and at least one more at the top of the road down to Switzers (0.5 mi. east on the hwy.).  </p>
