<center><h3><b>Mill Creek Summit to Round Top Mountain</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: About 9 miles round trip.<br>
Elevation Gain: 1400 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: The starting point, Mill Creek Summit, is 24 miles from La Canada by way of Angeles Crest and Angeles Forest Highways.  When you approach the summit, you’ll see a picnic area on the south side. Turn south on a paved side road here and drive 0.3 miles to the Pacific Crest Trail trailhead parking area.</p>

<p>The Hike:  The hike is all on dirt roads, which makes all grades rather gentle.  The first part is on the Pacifico Mountain Road, which actually runs from Mill Creek Summit past Pacifico Mountain to Chilao Flat.  Stay on the well-maintained road and don’t stray onto lesser side roads.</p>

<p>At about 2.5 miles turn right on the road to Granite Mountain and Roundtop Campground.  This turn is very well marked by a sign that says Granite Mountain is 1 mile.  Hike along the road past Granite Mountain to Roundtop (about 2 miles).</p>

<p>For extra effort, one could add in Granite Mountain.  There is no trail.  Quite simply, when you see Granite Mountain on the left, pick a good spot to scramble up to the peak.  It’s not real treacherous, and you may notice the faint trace of an old road.  There is a sign-in can in a bunch of Granite Boulders at the top.  Continue north along a ridge (there’s the trace of an old road) until you see the road again on your right and walk down to the road.</p>

<p>Refreshments will be served in the trailhead parking lot.</p>
