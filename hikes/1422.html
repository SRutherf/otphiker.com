<p><strong>Summary:&nbsp; </strong>The Silverlake neighborhood east of Echo Park varies from quite modest, small homes, weed strewn empty lots, small stores along Sunset Blvd. to large mansions overlooking the lake itself.&nbsp; If all goes well, we will traverse 11 separate stairways (2 stairs twice) containing a total of 1,408 stairs -- some of them going up, some going down.&nbsp; Eight of these stairways have paintings either on the stairs themselves or else on their retaining walls.&nbsp; We start and end at the "Music Box Stairs" made famous by the Laurel and Hardy movie depicting them trying to deliver a piano up the stairs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh5wzsy2q38">(watch the movie)</a>.&nbsp; Please note: pianos will not be provided on this hike, so if you are so motivated, bring along your own.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> We meet at the bottom of the Music Box Stairs located near 921/923 Vendome Street (north end of Laurel & Hardy Park). &nbsp; Exit the Hollywood (101) freeway at Silver Lake Blvd. and head north. &nbsp; Our goal is to reach West Sunset Blvd. headed north-west, but Silver Lake crosses <u>under</u> Sunset so you either have to take a left onto Parkman Ave, or else a right on Ellett Place - <u>before</u> the Sunset bridge. &nbsp; Either one will get you up to Sunset, where you will turn left to go north west on Sunset.</p>

<p>Look for North Vendome Street on your left just after you cross North Reno St., turn left and procede southerly until you reach Laurel & Hardy park - a small triangular grassy area appearing on your left.&nbsp; Park on any of the surrounding streets being mindful of their one-way directions. &nbsp; The Music Box Steps are on the west side of Vendome at the north end of the park.&nbsp; There is an identifying sign on a post at the foot of the stairs, and a plaque on one of the steps.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:&nbsp;</strong> Google "Painted stairways of LA" for a complete orientation of these art projects and various stairway tours.&nbsp; We will traverse 6 of these painted stairs (look for a <i>Painted</i> notation in the table below). </p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> The hike can only be described in tabular form.&nbsp; See <a href="../images/1422_description/Silverlake_Instructions.pdf">Silverlake Instructions</a>.&nbsp; Each stairway is numbered (i.e. S1, S2...).&nbsp; The direction (up or down) is given next.&nbsp; The number of stairs and a cum number of stairs is next.&nbsp; The presence or absence of a  handrail is given next.&nbsp; The final column gives directions to follow <u><strong>after</strong></u> traversing the stairs.</p>

<p>End of hike gathering for those who survive will be at the Laurel & Hardy Park.&nbsp;
