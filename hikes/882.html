<p>Distance: 6 miles RT<br> 
Elevation gain: 800 ft.</p>
 
<p>Directions to Trailhead: From US 101 exit Coldwater Canyon Ave.  Go south 2.5 miles to the intersection of Coldwater Canyon Ave. and Mulholland Drive (west) and make a ninety degree angle right turn onto Franklin Canyon Drive (a small residential street set back from the larger intersection).  Drive through the neighborhood approximately 0.5 miles and you will enter Franklin Canyon Park.</p>

<p><b>CAUTION</b>: Be aware that there are cameras at some stop signs. Be sure to make complete stops at every stop sign. Failing to heed this will result in a $100.00 fine - delivered courtesy of the USPO.</p>

<p>The Hike: The only trails that are clearly marked are the Hastain Trail and the Discovery trails. In the upper canyon there will be several lookouts and trails around the lake.  As we go down to the lower canyon we will descend about 200 ft  before arriving at the clearly marked Hastain trail.  We will walk up a weaving fire road to a lookout where there is a smaller trail to the right (which you will take on the way down), but we will make a sharp left turn onto the fire road.  This will lead us to an overlook where you can see part of the San Fernando Valley.</p>

<p>The fire road is blocked so we will then return to the previous look out and take the smaller trail to the left to return to Lake Drive.  We cross the road and follow the Discovery Trail, which parallels the Lake Drive road.  As we enter the upper canyon we will take Franklin Canyon road  to the left.  This is a one lane directional road and we will be facing traffic. There are dotted trails along the lake leading to the parking lot.</p>

<p>Background: Franklin Canyon is a beautiful canyon filled with sycamore and oak trees between Cold water canyon and Laurel Canyon. More than 90 species of birds have been sighted there.  Franklin Lake has bass, catfish, ducks and turtles.  Hundreds of movies and TV shows have been filmed there. There are numerous trails with benches and picnic areas.</p>
