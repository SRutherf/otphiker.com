<center><h3><b>Sepulveda Dam - Japanese Gardens</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 4 miles RT<br>
Elevation Gain: 100 ft.</p>

<p>Summary: Docent led tours of the Japanese Gardens starting at 9:30 AM are available but reservations are required. Our plan is to establish a list of interested hikers, and make the necessary reservations. The tour lasts about 1 1/4 hours, and the fee is $2 per person. Each tour is limited to 15 people, so that multiple tours may be required for our group. The gardens are open to unescorted touring by the public after 12:30 PM - the fee remains at $2.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 405 to the Burbank Blvd. off ramp in Van Nuys. Go west to & turn right onto Woodley Ave. On Woodley Ave. turn right at the entrance to the Japanese Garden & Wild Life Refuge at Woodley Park. Stay to the right at the entrance & park by the picnic tables. Allow 10-15 minutes to walk to the Japanese Garden from the trailhead.</p>

<p>The Hike: Those hikers planning on touring the Gardens will have to decide what portion of the hike they can do based on the time of their tour. There are several paths around the Wildlife Refuge area which extends south of the trailhead. A loop can be walked that includes climbing up onto the dam. There appears to be a homeless encampment in the area south of Burbank Blvd. which bisects the hike loop. Hikers can use the tunnel to cross under Burbank Blvd. or else cross the street at the stoplight at the 405 - Burbank Blvd. off ramps.</p>

<p>The hike length can be extended by hiking to 2 additional areas. Just north on Woodley there is an entrance on the left to the Model Plane Airport. It’s fun to watch if the planes are flying. Then further north on the left is an entrance to the Golf Course. If you walk down that road it will take you to Balboa Lake. You can walk around the Lake and then back to the trailhead adding about 2 1/2 miles to the total.</p>
