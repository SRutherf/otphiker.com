<p>Distance: 8 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1000 ft.<br>
Out and back hike, go as far as you want and return.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: This hike is in the western portion of the Puente Hills between the town of Whittier on the south and Rose Hills Memorial Park on the north.  The address is 2040-2050 Workman Mill Road, Whittier.  There is a sign that says "2040-2050" that marks the dirt road leading to the parking area just off Workman Mill road.  You must be driving north on Workman Mill to make this turn.  There is a large park sign a little way down the driveway and a sign directing you to the parking area.</p>

<p>Take the Whittier Blvd exit from the 605 Freeway (Between the 60 and the 5 Fwys). Proceed south-east on Whittier Blvd about .25 miles to Norwalk Blvd and turn left.  (You pass a Carl’s Jr on the left if you need a restroom).  Continue about 1.5 miles on Norwalk to Beverly Blvd.  (There is a Starbucks and a Weinerschnitzel at this intersection if you didn't stop at Carl’s).  Norwalk Blvd changes here to Workman Mill Rd and curves off to the left.  Continue another .75 mile to the trailhead. There are no restrooms at the trailhead or anywhere on the hike.</p>

<p>The Hike:  The trail starts at the edge of the parking lot and continues up Sycamore Canyon and then crosses the stream and switchbacks south up the hill to Skyline Drive (dirt road).  Turn left on Skyline.  Skyline is a well graded dirt road that continues east along the top of the hills.  We will go about 4 miles or so and return the way we came.</p>

<p>Refreshments: At the trailhead.</p>
