  <strong>Directions to Trailhead:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>From the valley: </strong>&nbsp; Take Topanga Canyon Road to PCH, and  then drive south to Sunset Blvd.&nbsp; Go east on Sunset for 0.3 miles (to the second  signal) and turn left on Los Liones Drive.&nbsp; Go north on Los Liones Drive for 0.3  miles and park in the first parking lot.&nbsp; If you pass the first parking lot, you  will come to a another parking lot 0.1 mile further up the road.&nbsp; You may park  in this lot if the first lot is full.&nbsp; If you reach the dead end of Los Liones  Drive, you have gone too far so turn around and drive back to the parking  lot.&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>From the south:</strong> Take PCH north to Sunset Blvd. and follow  instructions above.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Hike: </strong>&nbsp; This hike climbs the Los Liones Trail for  1.5 miles and 530 feet of elevation gain to a ridge-top clearing that looks  down on Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica, and the ocean beyond.&nbsp; On a clear day,  the view extends to Palos Verdes and Catalina Island.&nbsp; Those who want a short  hike may turn around here for a 3 mile RT hike.<br>
  <br>
Those who want a longer hike can continue along the  Topanga fire road to the Parker Mesa Overlook, which is 3.9 miles from the  trailhead at an elevation of 1547 feet ASL.&nbsp; The view here is  spectacular, similar to the first one, but from a higher elevation.&nbsp; Those eager  for more exercise may continue along the Topanga fire road before returning to  the trailhead.&nbsp; Several peaks along the fire road provide the opportunity for &quot;peak bagging.&quot;</p>
<p>There are bathrooms and picnic tables at the  trailhead.&nbsp; BYO refreshments.</p>
