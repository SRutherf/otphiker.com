<p><strong>Ron Forbess, Hike Leader</strong><br>


<p>Main Hike: 7.7 miles RT with 1950 feet cum elevation gain<br>
Short Hike: 2.5 miles RT with 525 feet cum elevation gain<br>
Main Hike Extension adds 1.2 miles RT</p>

<p><b>Directions to the Trailhead:</b> Take Pacific Coast Highway west 1.9 miles past Malibu Canyon Road and turn into the Corral Canyon Park parking lot on the north side of PCH. &nbsp; The parking lot is just east of the Malibu Seafood Restaurant and is easy to miss*. &nbsp; It is <i>important to note</i> that there is a barrier in the middle of PCH so when we leave we need to go west to Corral Canyon Road, turn around, and head back east toward Malibu. &nbsp; There is an iron ranger in the parking lot. &nbsp; The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority charges $5.00 to park. &nbsp; There is a restroom and picnic tables there.&nbsp; Click <a href="../aerialphotomaps/CorralCynParking.jpg">HERE</a> for map of parking lot.</p>

<p><b>Main Hike: To Mesa Peak.</b>&nbsp; Start by taking the Corral Canyon Loop trail in the counterclockwise direction. &nbsp; The loop junction is at 0.2 mile, turn right and continue up. &nbsp; At 0.9 miles there are two faint trails on the right going up from the main trail. &nbsp; Take the second one to the trail above, turn left and head north. &nbsp; Continue past a trail junction at 1.15 miles reaching the Puerco Motorway at 1.65 Miles. &nbsp; Continue up the Motorway until at 3.3 miles it begins to descend. &nbsp; At that point go up the steep trail to the left (west) side of the road to Mesa Peak. &nbsp; Return back down the motorway. &nbsp; At 5.2 miles you can explore an old house without roof to the left of the road. &nbsp; Continue down the road around the bend to a large flat area, cum distance here is 5.45 miles. &nbsp; At that point take the trail to the west labeled Zev Yaroslavsky Coastal Slope Trail up to the junction noted above. &nbsp; Turn left and continue back to the trail that goes down to the loop trail. &nbsp; Turn right to finish the Corral Canyon Loop Trail back to the trailhead. &nbsp; Note that it is 1.1 miles shorter to come back by the same route taken to the peak. &nbsp; However, you miss the visit to the old house and don’t complete the Corral Canyon Loop Trail.

<p><b>Short Hike: Corral Canyon Loop Trail.</b> Hike this loop in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.</p>

<p><b>Main Hike Extension:</b> Shortly before Mesa Peak a trail goes southeast for 0.6 mile to a viewpoint overlooking Pepperdine University. &nbsp; A trail goes down at that point but not sure where it ends.</p>
