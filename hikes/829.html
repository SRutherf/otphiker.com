<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take any freeway connecting to the 110 south.  Exit at the Harbor Blvd. off ramp, (this will be approximately 500 ft after the Channel St. off ramp). 
Turn right onto Harbor Blvd. and continue to 6th St.  Turn left and cross the railroad tracks. Since 6th St dead ends here, you now turn right and watch for the signs directing you to the Ports of Call Parking.  You will be parking toward the middle of the village by the Berth #77 (look for signs on the light poles).</p>

<p>We will begin our "hike" by walking back toward the Maritime Museum and taking a 20 min tour of it.</p>

<p>We will meet again outside the Museum and now walk toward the local Million Dollar Coast Guard Fireboat.  We will again have a short talk and tour of this impressive vessel.</p>

<p>After this we will again walk North toward the Lane Victory for a guided tour, which will get us into the engine room and etc. This will be a 45 min tour.</p>

<p>Back outside to the viewing area below the Lane Victory we will now enjoy the gourmet lunches we have brought for ourselves.  After lunch we will retrace our walk and return to the Ports of Call Parking area detouring by the Merchant Marine Memorial and then the Fishing Industry Memorial.  At Ports of Call we will board the Adventure Vessel for a round the world tour of Terminal Island which will be narrated by a Professional Tour Captain.  We will be having our end of the hike party while on the tour.</p>

Lane Victory: ---------$2.00<br>
Adventure Vessel: ----$8.00 (we are being given a 50% discount)<br>
