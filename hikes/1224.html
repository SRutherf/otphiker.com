<p>Hike 1224 <br>
May 6, 2015<br>
Orchard Camp via Mount Wilson Trail</p>

<p>Ron Forbess, Hike Leader</p>

<p>Distance: 7.0 miles RT; Elevation Gain: 2000 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 210 Freeway to the Baldwin Avenue off ramp in Arcadia.  Proceed north on Baldwin to Mira Monte and turn right.  Proceed to the trailhead at Mt. Wilson Drive.  Park on the street around the Mira Monte Park where we will have refreshments after the hike.  There is a restroom at the park.</p>

<p><b>The Basic Hike:</b> The hike is straight up 3.5 miles to Orchard Camp on the Mount Wilson Trail and back down.</p>

<p><b>Option 1:</b> First Water. This is not a loop hike and there are many places along the trail to stop and turn around.  The first scenic spot is at about 1.5 miles where the trail splits.  The main trail goes to the left and a trail to the right drops down to a beautiful streamside location.</p>

<p><b>Option 2:</b> Alternate route to Orchard Camp.  At the streamside from Option 1 continue on the trail along the stream.  That trail is usually not in good condition.  In about one half mile after a steep climb it rejoins the main trail.  This option is better used coming back from Orchard Camp.</p>

<p><b>Option 3:</b> Last Water.  To add another mile and 850 feet elevation gain continue up the Mount Wilson Trail out of Orchard Camp.  The trail climbs steadily and then descends in the final approach to the creek and the canyon bottom.</p>
