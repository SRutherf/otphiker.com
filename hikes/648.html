<p><center><h3><b>#648</b></h3></center><br>
<center><h3><b>Condor Peak from Vogel Flat</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 8 miles<br>
Elevation gain and loss: approximately 1200 ft.</p>

<p>DIRECTIONS TO TRAILHEAD: Exit the 210 at Sunland and turn left on Foothill Blvd.  Take Oro Vista north.  This turns into Big Tujunga Canyon Road.  Proceed 1.3 miles past the Stoneyvale/Vogel Flat turn-off to paddle 5.69.  Park to the left as shown by signs.</p>

<p>THE HIKE: The trail is a well maintained path through brush with little tree cover and no poison oak. The Forest Service has conveniently placed 8x8 post mile markers on the trail labeled I, II, III, and 4 (yes, three Roman numerals and the 4th Arabic).</p>

The plan is to have lunch at exactly the 4 mile marker, which is at a curve into an impressive cliff formation giving us either sun or shade.  The trail skirts Fox Peak without reaching its peak.  We return the same way we went out.</p>

<p>For those who might like a somewhat shorter hike, approximately 1/4 mile past mile marker III the trail passes over a saddle with a vertical drop to either side and wonderful views.  Lunch on the trail without much shade.</p>
  
<p>POST HIKE REFRESHMENTS: From the trailhead we will return 1.3 miles west on Big Tujunga Canyon Road to the Stoneyvale/Vogel Flats turn-off, take the turn-off, descend the hill to the bottom, and turn right to the Vogel Flats picnic area for refreshments.  Toilets are available there.</p>
