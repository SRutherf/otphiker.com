<p><strong>Hike #1348<br>
  Ocean Trails, Friendship Park, Forrestal Reserve and Nike Radomes<br>
January 17, 2018</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hike Leader: John Leete</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meet at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.&nbsp; This will avoid the inconvenience and save costs to the hike leader.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>Directions to trail head:&nbsp;</strong> 110 Freeway to San Pedro (Gaffey exit), take Gaffey St. south to 25th St., then west to La Rotonda Dr.&nbsp; The parking area is at the end of La Rotonda Dr.&nbsp; Restrooms are available at the trail head, in Friendship Park, and in the club house.&nbsp; Please bring folding chairs.</p>
<p><strong>Hike options:&nbsp;</strong> Please look at and print the attached map.&nbsp; The loop up Marymount Trail through the Deane Dana Friendship Park is about 5.6 miles, a side trip to see the Nike radomes will add 3.1 miles.&nbsp; Picnic tables are available on the bluff in front of the club house, which is 0.4 miles (?) from the parking area.&nbsp; The loop from the club house through the Forrestal Nature Reserve will add about 2.6 miles (?).&nbsp; If that ain't enough Wendell and Ralph, you can jog down the beach to the Portuguese Bend Club.</p>
<p><strong>Cautions:&nbsp;</strong> The Friendship Park loop crosses the P.V. Drive South twice. Traffic can be active, so take care when crossing.&nbsp; When hiking on a road without sidewalks, please walk on the left side facing traffic (this was a question on my last driver's license test).&nbsp; Finally, 25th St. seems to be patrolled regularly, which may reflect on San Pedro in general, so watch your speed.</p>
