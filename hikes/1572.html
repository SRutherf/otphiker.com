<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> Take PCH 1 mile west of Kanan Dume Road to Westward Beach Road and turn left.&nbsp; When you reach the beach, park immediately on either side of the road. There is a restroom near the trailhead.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:</strong>&nbsp; There are headlands, cliffs, rocky coves, vast beaches, tide pools and whale watching at Point Dume. We will walk east along Westward Beach Road past the parking lot pay booth to the end of the road. We will then ascend 250 ft. to the top of this ancient coastal bluff sand dune for an incredible view.&nbsp; It is a perfect spot to watch for migrating gray whales in December-January (heading south) and March-April (heading north).</p>

	<p>A newly-built stairway descends on the other side of the bluff allowing access to a more isolated beach and some tide pooling opportunities.&nbsp;  Continue on down the beach for 2 miles to Paradise Cove Beach Cafe or beyond.&nbsp; Return the way you came.&nbsp; Note: for those desiring a shorter hike, go as far as you wish, and return.</p>
	<p>BYO refreshments and beach chairs for the after-hike gagthering at the trailhead.</p>
