<p>Distance: 5 mile loop<br>
Elevation gain = Unknown.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 210 freeway east towards Claremont and exit at BASELINE ROAD, EXIT 52. Turn left on BASELINE and travel 0.7 miles to N. MILLS AVE. Turn RIGHT onto N. MILLS Avenue and travel 1.5 miles to the park entrance which is at the end of the street. There are restrooms at the park.</p>

<p>The park consists of a variety of native chaparral, dominated by Laurel Sumac, Scrub Oak, Chamise and Poison Oak, coastal sage brush vegetation, characterized by several nearly pure stands of California Sagebrush and scattered varieties of Goldenbrush, as well as some patches of annual grasses. A well-developed understory of native ferns, perennial herbs and sub shrubs may also be found.</p>

<p>Natural drainage ways traverse the park creating intermittent (blueline) streams which flow out of the canyons. As a result, the land is dotted with riparian wood-lands, which include large clusters of California Sycamores, Coast Live Oaks, Canyon Live Oaks and White Alders. Some exotic vegetation may also be found, including several species of Eucalyptus, California Peppers and Olive trees.</p>
