<strong>Summary:</strong> There are three hike options:  Mild, moderate and difficult. This was the <a href="0002.pdf">2nd OTP hike</a> done on December 19, 1989, led by Mike Gessner.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to the Trailhead:</strong> Take the 5 to the 14 North. At about 3 miles on Hwy 14, take the Placerita Canyon off-ramp and turn right (east). At about 1.5 miles, the entrance to the Placerita Canyon Nature Center is on the right. Park in the main parking lot.</p> 

<p><strong>The Hikes:</strong> All hikes start at the Nature Center. See <a href="http://www.placerita.org/_img/brochure3.jpg">Placerita Nature Center Trail Guide</a>.</p>

<b>Mild Hike: </b> Walk the excellent and lovely Canyon Trail upstream to Walker Ranch and return the same way. 
</p>

<p><b>Moderate Hike:</b> Walk the same Canyon Trail upstream as above to Walker Ranch, then turn up the Los Pinetos Trail to the road at the top. Return the same way. This is a very pretty hike for the entire length.  <b>CAUTION:</b> It is advisable not to turn right at the top of the Los Pinetos trail and return on the Manzanita Mountain trail (The reverse of the Difficult hike) as you will be hiking downhill on close to 2 miles of loose, steep decomposed granite slopes.</p>

<p><b>Difficult Hike:</b> Start at the Nature Center parking lot and walk up the Manzanita Mountain trail (you'll be going in the opposite direction from the above hikes). This trail is quite steep and follows the ridgeline up to a road at the top. The scenery is lush chaparral at the bottom, giving way very soon to low scrub and grassland. At the top, turn left on the road and hike about ¼ mile until you come to a restroom. Immediately turn left  and continue down the Los Pinetos Trail to Walker Ranch and return to the Nature Center down the main Canyon Trail along the stream. </p> 

<p><b>Waterfall Trail:</b> This trail starts at Walker Ranch very close to the Los Pinetos trailhead. This relatively short trail can be added to any of the above hikes.</p>

<p>BYO refreshments across the stream from the Nature Center.</p>
