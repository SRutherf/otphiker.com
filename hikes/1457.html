<p><strong>Description of the Hike:</strong>&nbsp;  There are a number of variations for this hike.&nbsp; The terrain is rolling  hills going through trails and fire roads.&nbsp; You will see Oak and Black  Walnut Woodlands, native scrub brush and hopefully great views of the San  Gabriel Mountains.&nbsp; We start at a wooded and shaded park area and climb  gently to over 1300&rsquo;, where views can be stunning on clear days.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Directions to Schabarum Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong>  Go east on the Pomona Freeway (60). Exit at Azusa Ave. (exit #18) and go south  to Colima; left on Colima; right into Schabarum Park.&nbsp; Drive straight past  the guard booth and continue on the main park road (don't turn right).&nbsp;  After about 0.6 mi. you will come to a &quot;T&quot; intersection. Turn left  and follow the signs to the Equestrian Area.&nbsp; In another 0.2 mi. you will  arrive at the equestrian area.&nbsp; Park on the right.&nbsp; Bathrooms and  picnic tables are available at the park.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Basic Hike:&nbsp;</strong> 6.3 miles, about 1300 feet total  elevation gain &ndash; From the Schabarum Trailhead, head south (past the horse  corrals) on Powder Canyon Trail for 0.8 miles to the junction with the Black  Walnut Trail on the left.&nbsp; Follow Black Walnut Trail 1.0 miles to turnoff  to Nogales Trail (on the right).&nbsp; Take Nogales Trail a short .12 miles to  join Powder Canyon Trail, which is a dirt road at this point.&nbsp; Go right on  Powder Canyon and continue for 0.8 miles to the junction (on the left) with the  Purple Sage Trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Go left and follow Purple Sage Trail for 1.4 miles, past some antenna  stations on your right, to a clump of eucalyptus trees on the left.&nbsp; This  may be a good place for a break with shade and a nice view of the OC.&nbsp; As  you depart, turn north following the trail wrapping around the antenna hill and  you will reach the intersection with the Schabarum trail. Turn right and follow  this trail for 2.1 miles to return to the starting point.&nbsp; (Use caution  after 0.7 miles on the Schabarum Trail to make sure you stay on it as you round  an area with transmission towers).&nbsp; When you descend back to the edge of  the park, be sure to veer right to stay on the Schabarum trail, which will  bring you back to the equestrian area.
