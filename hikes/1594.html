<p><strong>Summary:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Silver Lake is an Eastside  neighborhood that fully embraces the hipster lifestyle. Funky blocks with  street art are lined with artisanal coffee shops, vegan cafes, and creative  Asian eateries, as well as indie music venues, trendy bars, and boutiques. The  area also includes fine examples of modernist architecture and a namesake  reservoir that&rsquo;s ringed by a popular walking trail with a dog park and a grassy  meadow.&nbsp;We will traverse 11 separate stairways (2 stairs twice) containing  a total of 1,408 stairs -- some of them going up, some going down. Eight of  these stairways have paintings either on the stairs themselves or else on their  retaining walls. We start and end at the &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4e_OKj20w">Music Box Steps</a>&quot; made  famous by the Laurel and Hardy movie depicting them trying to deliver a piano  up the stairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no facilities, so you may wish to stop  at the McDonald's at 1417 Glendale Blvd.<br>
  <strong><br>
  Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We meet at Laurel  &amp; Hardy Park, near the bottom of the Music Box Steps located at 923  Vendome Street. Exit the Hollywood (101) and take  exit&nbsp;5A&nbsp;for&nbsp;Rampart Blvd. &nbsp;Continue on&nbsp;N Rampart Blvd.  Take&nbsp;W Sunset Blvd&nbsp;to&nbsp;N Vendome St. You will reach Laurel &amp;  Hardy park - a small triangular grassy area appearing on your left. Park on any  of the surrounding streets being mindful of their one-way directions. The Music  Box Steps are on the west side of the park. There is an identifying sign on a  post at the foot of the stairs, and a plaque on one of the steps.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Suggestion:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Google &quot;Painted stairways  of LA&quot; for a complete orientation of these art projects and various  stairway tours. We will traverse 6 of these painted stairs (look for a&nbsp;Painted&nbsp;notation  in the table below).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Hike:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The hike can only be described  in tabular form. See&nbsp;<a href="../images/1594_description/Silverlake_Instructions_Rev_2.pdf">Silverlake  Instructions Rev 2</a>.&nbsp; Each stairway is numbered (i.e., S1, S2...).&nbsp; The  direction (up or down) is given next. The number of stairs and a cumulative  number of stairs is next. The presence or absence of a handrail is given next. The  final column gives directions to follow&nbsp;after&nbsp;traversing the  stairs.<br>
  <br>
  End of hike gathering for those who survive will be at the  Laurel &amp; Hardy Park.&nbsp; Please bring chairs.<br>
