<center><h3><b>Chino Hills State Park - Soquel Entrance</b></h3></center></p

><p>Distance: Main hike: 6 miles RT, 1450 ft. elevation gain.<br>
Short hike: 5 miles RT, 700 ft. elevation change.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead:  Take the 71 freeway south (or north as applicable) and exit at Soquel Canyon Parkway. Go west 1 mile and turn left on Elinvar Drive which turns sharply left at the end. Look immediately right for a dirt road entering the State Park, which becomes pavement again in two miles. Shortly after that you will see the Aliso Canyon Campground on your left. Enter and turn right to the end of the dirt road to a closed gate and a parking area.</p>

<p>The Hike: Our hike starts at the Aliso Canyon Campground, going south for ½ mile and crossing the creek, then turning right at the junction ahead.  After about 100 yards the signed Water Canyon Trail will start. In about ½ mile we will come to a sign indicating the end of the trail – ignore it and keep on walking for another ¼ mile, then follow the path that veers steeply northwest for about 0.4 mile to meet South Ridge Trail.</p>

<p>Here we split into the various optional hikes:</p>

<p>Short hike: Turn right and continue on South Ridge Trail to the Aliso Canyon Trail and back on the road we started out on to the campground.</p>

<p>Main hike: Turn left to the Telegraph Canyon Trail and at the next Y turn right to continue on Telegraph Canyon to Aliso Canyon Trail then return as per above.</p>

<p>Alternate hikers may turn left at that Y and take any loop, ending at the Aliso Canyon Trail and back per above. </p>

<p>Refreshments back at the trailhead.</p>
