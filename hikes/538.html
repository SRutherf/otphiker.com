<p><strong>Hike #538<br>
  The Bridge to Nowhere<br>
October 25, 2000
</strong>
<p><strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Dick Battin
</strong>
<p><strong>9:30 am</strong><br>
  <br>
  9.6 miles with 1000 ft elevation  gain<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Directions:&nbsp;</strong> From I-210, exit Azusa Ave. (State 39) north  into the Angeles National Forest.&nbsp; Drive  10 miles along San Gabriel Canyon Rd; turn right at East Fork Rd.&nbsp; Follow it 7 miles to its terminus at East  Fork Ranger Station.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Hike:&nbsp;</strong> Do not go up the Glendora  Rd.&nbsp; You will need an Adventure  pass.&nbsp; Alice has led us several times on  this hike and I hope she is along so we can always take the shortest  route.&nbsp; You will get your feet wet  because there are 20 stream crossings, many of which are hard to find the dry  way across.&nbsp; Last time Roland made it  across all of them dry then chose to wade on the way back to keep cool.&nbsp; The second point is to bring lots of water as  that canyon is hot and everyone ran out of water last time.&nbsp; Plan to enjoy a swim at the bridge.
<p>The hike is discussed on page 32 of the current Sunset  magazine.&nbsp; I have been handing out copies  and will have more on hike day if you missed out.</p>
