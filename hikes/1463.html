Hesperia Ave. Turn left into Aliso Canyon Park.

<p><b>Basic Hike:</b>&nbsp; The hike starts north of the parking lot and continues through the shaded canyon for approximately 1.5 miles.&nbsp; The final section is a short but steep climb up to Sesnon Blvd.&nbsp;Once on Sesnon Blvd., look east across the Canyon and you will see the continuation of Sesnon Blvd., giving the impression that there should have been a bridge across the Canyon but they ran out of money!!!</p>
<p>Head west on Sesnon Blvd. for 0.6 miles then turn left on Tampa Ave. Take the Limekiln Trail that runs parallel to, and on the west side of, Tampa Ave. After 0.4 miles turn left up a narrow uphill path to rejoin Tampa, cross over the road and enter an unsigned trailhead.&nbsp; This is the beginning of the Porter Ranch Ridge Trail.&nbsp; Continue on the Porter Ranch Ridge Trail for 1.6 miles, until you reach Reseda Blvd.&nbsp; Turn right along Reseda Blvd. and go south for 0.15 miles.&nbsp; Cross over Reseda&nbsp; Blvd. just before reaching Eddleston Dr.&nbsp; Enter an unsigned trailhead with tennis courts on your right.&nbsp; Continue for 0.75 miles, heading east, then south until you reach the Aliso Canyon Park Trailhead.</p>
<p><strong>Option&nbsp;1 (Not shown on map):</strong> On reaching Sesnon and Tampa, continue on Sesnon, passing the SCE Aliso&nbsp;Gas Field Entrance. Immediately turn right onto an unmarked horse trail (Morman Canyon Loop becoming Moonshine Canyon Trail). Continue heading west past homes on your left, eventually meeting up with Sesnon Blvd. on your left. Continue until you reach an underpass under Sesnon. Turn around and retrace your steps back to Sesnon and Tampa.&nbsp;Continue as descibed above. This side trip adds an extraa 2.5 miles RT.</p>
