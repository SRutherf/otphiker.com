Optional Hike (green):	RT = 7.4 miles; Cum Elevation = 1000 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> The trailhead is the parking lot and small road adjacent to the Peninsula Education Foundation office at 300 Paseo del Mar.&nbsp; Reach the trailhead by exiting the 405 freeway and heading South on Hawthorne Blvd.&nbsp; About half way up the Palos Verdes hill turn right on Palos Verdes Dr. North.&nbsp; Continue West 2.4 miles to the triangular intersection and bear left as Palos Verdes Dr. transitions from North to West.&nbsp; Continue a block through the Malaga Cove commercial district and turn right at Via Corta, which curves into Via Almar.&nbsp; Turn right from Via Almar onto Via Arroyo and after a block turn right into the parking lot and small road, which continues a few hundred feet. Rest rooms are available to the South, across the expanse of grass.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:</strong>&nbsp; A detailed map will be supplied on hike day.&nbsp; The Basic Hike is in one direction from the trailhead to the a house and the party.&nbsp; The hike begins up the small road, transitions to a trail, and then onto city streets as it progresses in front of the Malaga Cove commercial district.&nbsp; (From the open area look up the hill and you can see the cut for the fire road we will be on later.)&nbsp; Continue on Via Tejon to a large open area, bounded by Palos Verdes Drive North and Palos Verdes Golf Course on the East.</p>

<p>There are a multitude of trails in this open area. Stay along the crest until you reach the golf course and their “Keep Out” signs.&nbsp; Some may choose to return from here, but the main hike soon heads south up a heavy foliaged streambed, which is below power lines.&nbsp; After crossing below the bridge for Via Campesina, turn right and continue on the Paseo del Sol fire road, (it’s the cut seen earlier from below).</p>

<p>Continue as Paseo del Sol turns from a fire road to a real road and crosses Via del Monte.&nbsp; The Basic Hike continues up Paseo del Sol and turns downward on the trail after 1821 Paseo del Sol.&nbsp; The trail progresses to Palos Verdes Dr. West.&nbsp; Turn right, as the hike follows the median until it ends.&nbsp; Cross Palos Verdes Dr. West to the small parking lot and “Viewpoint”.&nbsp; The Basic Hike works West along the bluff to Avon Road.&nbsp; Go left up Avon Road to address 605; the blue house with white trim.&nbsp; From the “Viewpoint” the “Rabbit Run” turns right and progresses along the bluff, then residential streets, and then ultimately down a dirt path to the ocean at Bluff Cove.&nbsp; Rabbits must retrace their steps to the “Viewpoint” and rejoin the Basic Hike.</p>

<p>The Major Hike Option continues down Via del Monte from the junction with Paseo del Sol.&nbsp; Be careful, Via del Monte is a fairly busy street.&nbsp; Enter the access road to the La Venta Inn, a popular wedding venue and party spot.&nbsp; Bear right and merge with Via Somonte until, across from 820 Via Somonte take the downward path and stairs.&nbsp; Walk up Via del Monte and turn right and follow Via Arriba, and then the path and downward stairs across from 1704 Via Arriba.&nbsp; At the bottom of the stairs turn hard right and follow the path back to the Malaga Cove commercial district, and then retrace your steps back to the trailhead.</p>

<p>Party at 605 Avon Road.&nbsp; Bring a swimsuit if you would like to party in the spa.&nbsp; Please help with car shuttles from the party back to the trailhead.</p>
