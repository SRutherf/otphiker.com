<strong><font color="#FF0004">Updated after the La Tuna Verdugo Fire</font></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Phil Rutherford</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meet at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>

<p><strong>Suummary:&nbsp; </strong>This will be the sixth time this hike has been done.&nbsp; The previous hikes were  <a href="0316.pdf">316</a> (Ron Forbess), <a href="506.pdf">506</a>, (Richard Braun) <a href="639.html">639</a> (Richard Braun), <a href="1017.pdf">1017</a> (Jack Robinson) and <a href="1077.pdf">1077</a> (Jack Robinson).</p>
<p><strong>Trailhead Directions:</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>From the west,</strong> take the I-210 freeway, take exit 17 for Pennsylvania Ave.&nbsp; Turn right on Pennsylvania Ave.&nbsp; Pennsylvania Ave. becomes Honolulu Ave.&nbsp; After 1.0 miles, turn right on La Cresenta Ave.&nbsp; After 0.4 miles, turn right on Oakmont View Drive.&nbsp; After 0.6 miles turn left on Barnes Circle.&nbsp; After 0.3 miles, turn right on Beaudry Terrace.&nbsp; After 0.1 mile, trailhead is where Beaudry Terrace becomes Beaudry Blvd.&nbsp; Street address is 1301 Beaudry Blvd., Glendale.&nbsp; Park on the street.</p>
<p><strong>From the south,</strong> take the SR-2 freeway, take exit 18 for Mountain Street.&nbsp; Turn left on E. Mountain St.&nbsp; After 0.5 miles, turn right onto N. Verdugo Rd.&nbsp; After 0.2 miles, keep left to continue on Canada Blvd.&nbsp; After 1.6 miles, turn left onto Country Club Drive.&nbsp; After 0.5 miles, turn left onto Beaudry Blvd.&nbsp; After 0.4 miles, trailhead is where Beaudry Blvd. becomes Beaudry Terrace.&nbsp; Park on the street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no restrooms at the trailhead. </p> 

<p><strong>Basic Hike (Green Track):&nbsp; </strong>From the trailhead (el. 1,188 ft.), we start up the fire road alongside a debris basin.&nbsp; At 0.4 miles the road forks into Beaudry South Mtwy and Beaudry North Mtwy.&nbsp; We'll take the north road up ... right fork (not as steep!). &nbsp; After another 2.1 miles the two roads meet again at the Beaudry North-South junction (el. 2,506 ft.).&nbsp; Those wanting a shorter hike, can have lunch at the junction and head back to the trailhead via the Beaudry South Mtwy.&nbsp; After 0.75 miles from the junction, take the left fork back to the trailhead.&nbsp; This option is a RT of 5.8 miles and a net elevation gain of 1,318 ft.</p>
<p><strong>Extended Hike (Yellow Track):&nbsp;</strong> Those wishing a longer hike can continue from the Beaudry North-South junction west along the Verdugo fire road for as long as they wish.&nbsp; The distance all the way to Verdugo Peak (el. 3.142 ft.) is 2.5 miles&nbsp;or an additional RT of 5.0 miles.&nbsp; Those wanting a change from the fire road, can take the narrower trail that follows the mountain ridge and generally parallels the fire road until it reaches Verdugo Peak.&nbsp; This ridge trail starts about 100 yards back down the Beaudry South Mtwy  on the right.&nbsp; A short scramble up a rocky slope will get you to the ridge trail.&nbsp; However, as a mitigation measure to prevent the spread of the La Tuna Fire, this ridge trail has been bulldozed into a fire break ... it is therefore a wide, loose soil, trail that may not be to everyone's taste.&nbsp; After reaching Verdugo Peak, retrace your steps back to the trailhead via the Beaudry South Mtwy for a total RT of 10.8 miles and a net elevation gain of 1,954 ft.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0004"><strong>Updated after the La Tuna Verdugo Fire:&nbsp;</strong> As of September 4, the fire appears to be 100% contained.&nbsp; The <a href="../aerialphotomaps/La_Tuna_Burn_Area.pdf">Burn Map</a> shows that most of Hike #1338, which is in the lower south-east portion of the Verdugo Mountains, appears to have escaped the fire.&nbsp; It appears that only the last mile along the Verdugo Fire Road upto Verdugo Peak (Yellow Track) is in the Burn Area.</font></p>
<p>Refreshments will be served at the trailhead.&nbsp; There are no picnic tables, so please bring your own chairs.</p>
