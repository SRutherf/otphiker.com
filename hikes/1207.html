<p><center><h3><b>#1207<br>
Fish Canyon & Falls</b></h3></center></p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
Distance = 5.7 mi. RT; Max. elevation change = 720 ft.

<p>Directions to Trailhead: For people coming north on the 605 freeway: the 605 ends at Huntington Drive. Turn right (east) on Huntington Dr. In about 0.4 mi, Huntington Dr. transitions to off toward the south. Watch for La Lomas road crossing Huntington Dr. About 0.1 mile <b>past</b> Las Lomas road is Encanto Parkway coming in from the left (rock sign is in the middle of the Parkway). Turn left on Encanto Parkway (eventually becomes Fish Canyon road) and follow the road to the end, about 1 mile past the museum, and park. At the end of the road there will be 3 gates. The parking lot is thru the middle gate. There is room for about 40 cars, however there are NO seats anywhere, so bring your own chairs.</p>

<p>For people on the 210 freeway, exit Irwindale Ave. North to Foothill Blvd. and turn left (west). Continue west on Foothill across the San Gabriel River Bridge and turn right (north) on Encanto Parkway, then follow the instructions above.</p>

<p>The Hike: The trail begins at the far north end of the lot. It's a great path and fenced in to keep us under control and away from Azusa Rock quarry operations. Eventually we leave the fenced area and follow a trail, it would be wise to use hiking sticks beyond this point.</p>
