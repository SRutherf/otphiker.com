<center><h3><b>Charmlee Regional Park</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 3.5 mi. loop plus 3.2 mi. side trip option<br>
Elevation gain: 500 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: From the south: Drive north on Pacific Coast Highway to Encinal Canyon Road (approx. 4 miles beyond Kanan Road junction). Turn right on Encinal Canyon and drive about 4 miles to Charmlee Park. Turn left and enter park.</p>

<p>From the Valley: Drive west on Ventura Freeway. Left on Kanan Road. Right on Mulholland Highway. After a short distance, left on Encinal Canyon Road. At junction (Decker Road) keep to the left and continue on Encinal Canyon Road. Turn right to enter park.</p>

The Hike: From the parking lot, keep right and walk on pavement to Nature Center. Bear right on a paved road, which soon becomes dirt, that bends up a slope. Make an acute left turn at the top, follow a ridge road past a hilltop water tank (if not yet enclosed by fence- walk around tank for good overview of park and ocean), and then curve down to a "T" intersection. Turn right. At junction of "Fire Ecology Trail" keep to the right and follow the Long Hill Trail approximately 0.8 miles to the end.</p>

<p>Backtrack on Long Hill Trail to previous junction. Take "Fire Ecology Trail" to Post 10, go right on a road that winds along the west edge of Charmlee's large central meadow. Continue to dry ridge topped by eucalyptus trees, and a concrete lined cistern (relic of cattle ranching days). From there descend south (stay right at the next junction) to the "Ocean Vista". Follow the trail to the south and continue on the "East Meadow Trail". Then to the "Botany Trail" and back to the picnic area and vehicles.</p>

<p>Since there are many trails and you may find yourself hiking on a different trail than listed above. Fear not, they eventually they all lead back to the picnic area.</p>

<p>CAUTION: Description is not clear if it describes the 3.5 mi. hike, with or without the 3.2 mi. side trip. This hike should be scouted to make certain.</p>
