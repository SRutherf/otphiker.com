<p>Hike #1265<br>
Rocky Peak via the Chumash Trail<br>
March 16, 2016</p>

<p>Roland Bassett, Hike Leader</p>

<p>Distance: 8 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1500 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 118 west and exit on Yosemite (2nd exit after Rocky Peak). Go north ½ mile and turn right on Flanagan Drive. Go ¾ miles to the end and park on the street. There are no restrooms at the trailhead, but there is a gas station and a McDonalds as you get off the freeway on the left side of the road.</p>

<p>The Hike: We start up the Chumash trail which intersects Rocky Peak Road in about 3 miles. There are markers every ½ mile. Turn right and continue up Rocky Peak Road to the Rocky Peak cutoff, which we take out to the peak. We return to the trailhead the way we came.</p>

<p>Shorter Option: Turn around wherever you want!</p>
