<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.&nbsp; This will avoid the inconvenience and save costs to the hike leader.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
RT = 6.8 mi.to Paradise Cove<br>
Elevation gain/loss 250 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> Take PCH 1 mile west of Kanan Dume Road to Westward Beach Road and turn left.&nbsp; Go about 3/4 mile to the toll booth and park on the road or else pay the fee ($10?) and park in the parking lot.&nbsp; There is a restroom near the trailhead.  Refreshments will be served near where we park.&nbsp; There are no picnic tables.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:</strong>&nbsp; There are headlands, cliffs, rocky coves, vast beaches, tide pools and whale watching at Point Dume.&nbsp; We will walk to the east end of the parking lot where we will ascend 250 ft. to the top of this ancient coastal bluff sand dune for an incredible view.&nbsp; It is a perfect spot to watch for migrating gray whales but not likely to see any.</p>

	<p>A stairway descends on the other side of the bluff allowing access to a more isolated beach and some tide pooling opportunities.&nbsp;  Continue on down the beach for 2 miles to Paradise Cove or beyond.&nbsp; Return the way you came.&nbsp; Note: for those desiring a shorter hike, go as far as you wish, and return.&nbsp; It might be wise to prepare for some wet feet.</p>
