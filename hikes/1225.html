<p>Hike 1225 <br>
May 13, 2015<br>
Pacoima Canyon & Mendehall Ridge Road</p>

<p>Jim Carlin, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
RT (out to Dagger Flat & return) = 7.2 mi. and 500 ft. elevation change.<br>
RT (to Mendenhall Peak & return) = 9.4 mi. and 1700 ft. elevation gain</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Exit the 210 Freeway at Osborne St. For those travelling from the west, turn left at the bottom of the off-ramp onto Foothill Blvd, go under the freeway, then turn left on Osborn St. (which ultimately becomes Little Tujunga Canyon Road). For those travelling from the east, turn right at the bottom of the off-ramp onto Foothill Blvd. then turn right on Osborn St. In either case, <b>do three things:</b><br>
1) Follow large signs to the Wildlife Waystation.<br>
2) Note speedometer reading upon reaching Osborne St.<br>
3) Checkout small shopping area on your left where there are businesses for a possible pit-stop. There are no other restrooms available on the hike.</p>

<p>Continue up Little Tujunga Road 7.4 miles (passing the ranger station, Gold Road and the Wildlife Waystation) to the fire road 3N32 intersection. There is a small clearing on both sides of the road with white pipe gates blocking the north/south access to the dirt fire road. This is the Dillon Divide, our trailhead. There is room for possibly 7 cars on the north side if parked head-in, and perhaps 2 or 3 cars on the south side. Otherwise, park with care along side of the road before or after the gate.</p>

<p>The Hike: Starting from the north side of the Dillon Divide take Mendenhall Ridge Road (3N32) approx. 0.4 mi to a trail on left side marked by a faded yellow metal pole. The trail, an old road, descends contouring down the side of the canyon to its bottom where the road ends. The canyon bottom trail crosses the stream bed many times. Look for "ducks" on opposite side of the stream where the trail picks up again. Continue upstream to a wide place, the former site of Dutch Louie's campground (no trace remains). Beyond Louie's campground is Dutch Louie's mine, a hole in the rock face hidden behind some bushes on the left side of the canyon. Dagger Flat, a large open area, comes next as we hike further into the canyon, and beyond, the canyon narrows significantly. Continue upstream as far as you wish. Vestiges of a trail disappear - just pick your way over the streambed rocks and "islands". Return the way you came.</p>

<p>Optional Hike: Hike the Mendenhall Ridge Road as far as you wish. Note: It is 4.7 mi one way from the trailhead to Mendenhall Peak (turn right at the fork leading up to the peak) with 1700 ft. elevation gain.</p>

<p>Conditions in 2015 are very dry in the canyon and on the road. Bring sufficient water and sun screen.</p>

<p>Refreshments back at the trailhead.</p>
