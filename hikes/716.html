<center><h3><b>Verdugo Mountains from Stough Canyon</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 8.5 miles<br>
Elevation gain: short hike = 1000 ft.; long hike = 1700 ft.</p> 

<p>Trailhead Directions: From I-5 in Burbank, exit Olive Avenue Dr. and drive 1 1/4 miles northeast (toward the mountains) to Sunset Canyon Drive and turn left. Drive 3/4 mile to Walnut Avenue and turn right (north) to the end of the road, about 1 mile. Parking and toilets are at Stough Canyon Nature Center.</p>

<p>The Hike: Start north up the Fire Road. About 1/2 mile you will come to a junction where there is a bench. We take the trail to the left. We pass a Youth Camp with only a foundation and chimney left. It was built in the 1920's and rebuilt in 1960. The trail climbs to the east and meets the Verdugo Fire Road.</p>

<p>Take the road to the right. This brings you to a junction. The shorter hikers will take the right branch and return to the Nature Center. The longer hikers will take the left branch for about 2 miles to the Fire Warden Grove (AKA The Experimental Forest). The road splits as you approach the Grove. Take the right fork to the base of the Communication Facility. This is a good place for lunch.</p>

<p>The return trail starts at the large bench, which overlooks Burbank and the San Fernando Valley. The trail down is steep, but it has stair steps most of the way. Do not take the 2 trails you pass on the left. At the top of a small rise, the trail splits. Stay to the left, then stay to the right the rest of the way. At the bottom, go right through the parking lot and then cross the road (Harvard). Stay on the golf cart path until you come to De Bell Road on your right. Take it to the end which is Walnut Avenue and turn right to the cars.</p>

<p>Refreshments served at the trailhead.</p>
