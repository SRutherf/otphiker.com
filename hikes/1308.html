<strong>Hike #1308<br>
Will Rogers to Backbone Trail<br>
February 22, 2017</p>

</strong>
 <p><strong>Wolfgang Jahn, Hike Leader</strong></p>

<p><b>Summary:</b> Basic hike climbs out of the park to the junction with the Backbone trail, then follows the Backbone as far as one wishes. </p> 

<p><b>Directions to Trailhead:</b> Valley folks can take Topanga Canyon Road to PCH, and then south to Sunset Blvd. About 3 miles up Sunset turn left on Will Rogers State Park Road. Alternately, take the 405 freeway to Sunset Blvd, go west about 7 miles, and then right on Will Rogers State Park Road.</p>

<p>Coming from the south, take PCH to Sunset Blvd. and follow instructions above. Note that there is a <u>parking fee of $11</u> for seniors, or you can use a pass from the California State Park Foundation.</p> 

<p><b>The Hike:</b> The basic hike starts from the picnic area up a service road to the Inspiration Loop Trail, turn left onto the trail to do the loop clockwise. Just north of Inspiration Point we will come upon a fork with the Backbone Trail. Turn left up the Backbone Trail and continue until your heart is content. A nice spot for lunch is a massive oak tree on the trail at about 1 mile beyond the Backbone junction. Return back down to Inspiration Loop Trail, turn left to complete the clockwise loop back to the picnic area.</p>

<p>Short hikers can continue clockwise on the Inspiration Loop Trail for a total of about 2 miles with about 300 ft. elevation gain.</p>

<p>A dry weather option for this hike is Rustic Canyon.&nbsp; See for instance <a href="1270.html">hike #1270</a>.&nbsp; However this option is not recommended during the rainy season.</p>
