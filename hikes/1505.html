<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
  Trailhead to Gould Mesa = 5.5 mi RT, 372 ft. elev. gain/loss.<br>
Trailhead to Nino Picnic Area = 6.5 mi RT, 434 ft. elev.  gain/loss.<br>
Trailhead to Paul Little Campground = 8.7 mi RT, 700  ft. elev. gain/loss.</p>
<p><b>Directions to Trailhead:</b>&nbsp; From 210, exit at Oak Grove/Berkshire off ramp.&nbsp; Go East on Berkshire Place. Turn Left where it dead-ends into Oak Grove Drive.&nbsp; Turn right at the first light into Hahamonga Watershed Park. After entering the park, take the first left down to the stop sign. Park near the ball field.</p>

<p><b>The Hike:</b>&nbsp; From the parking lot at the ball field, go thru the yellow gates and then left on the wide dirt path that runs along the perimeter of the Frisbee golf course. Stay on the trail passing the large parking structure for JPL, continue until the trail makes a small right dip and then stay on the trail with the cement berm to your left.&nbsp; You come out at the JPL turnstile.  Turn right and go to a hole in the fence (there is a Road Narrows Sign) follow the trail along the river and go under the bridge and cross to the left and climb out to a paved road.</p>

<p>At the large brown sign, keep to the left.&nbsp; You will pass Ranger housing and a bridge and come to a picnic table, a good place to stop for cookies.  Continue on to Gould Camp (this is approximately a 5.5 mi RT to this point).&nbsp; Further past Gould Camp (appx 1 mile) are waterfalls.  The trail continues on to the Nino Picnic Area (6.5 mi RT) and the Paul Little Campground (8.7 mi RT).&nbsp; Return the way you came.</p>  

<p><strong>For  more Mileage:  </strong>&nbsp;When you reach the large brown sign, instead of going to Paul Little  Campground, go up the trail which bypasses the dam and continues for about 1.7  miles to the Oakwilde Campground site. That trail is part of the  Gabrielino Trail which goes past Switzer&rsquo;s Picnic Area and then all the way to  Chantry Flats.</p>
