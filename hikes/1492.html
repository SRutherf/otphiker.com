<p><strong>Trailhead Directions:&nbsp;</strong> Enter Bridge to Nowhere Trailhead into Google Maps or Apple Maps apps.&nbsp; Take the I-210 Freeway to the Azusa off ramp.&nbsp; Turn left  (north), Azusa Avenue will become San Gabriel Canyon Road and is also SR 39.&nbsp; Follow it up the mountain to the East Fork Bridge at the north end of the san Gabriel Reservoir.&nbsp; Turn right over the bridge onto East Fork Road and  continue past the Camp Williams Resort.&nbsp; It becomes a little tricky when you come to the  intersection of the Glendora Mountain Road on your right.&nbsp; Turn right and immediately turn left  crossing over Glendora Road onto Camp Bonita Road.&nbsp; Do not turn onto Glendora Mountain Road.&nbsp; Continue to a white bridge and cross it, go up to the end of the road and park in  the East Fork Day Use Parking lot. There is a pit toilet there.&nbsp; If the lot is full, there is plenty of overflow parking back along Camp Bonita Road.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> Hike past the locked gate to Heaton Flat.&nbsp; At Heaton Flat cross the river for the  first of many crossings.&nbsp; Continue up-river past Swan Rock to the Narrows. The last 1.25 miles to the bridge is unshaded without the benefit of the cooling stream .&nbsp; Have  lunch on the bridge and return to the cars.&nbsp; Be prepared to make many stream  crossings.&nbsp; HINT:&nbsp; The road that used to go to the bridge was on the east side.&nbsp; You  can often find portions of a trail over there which cuts down on the number of  crossings.&nbsp; On Hike #1416 we did approximately 12 crossings upstream but approximately 6 downstream by making better use of the east trail/road.&nbsp; Water level obviously depends on the season.&nbsp; On Hike #1416, water level was at knee level or less.&nbsp; Pace is slowed by the number of crossings.&nbsp; Hike #1416 took 6 hours and 20 mintes including 20 minutes lunch&nbsp;at bridge.</p>
