<p><strong>Directions:</strong>&nbsp; Brand Park is located at 1601 W Mountain St. in  Glendale.&nbsp; From Interstate 5 take Western Ave. north to Mountain St. and  turn right.&nbsp; Enter the park on the left.  &nbsp; We will meet in the lower parking lot just above the  baseball field next to a restroom.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Hike:</strong>&nbsp; The signed Seven Trees Trail starts behind  the former Brand Mansion now converted into a library.&nbsp; It climbs up to a  flat rest area with a bench and the seven trees about a mile from the  start. (<strong>The final climb is rather  steep and sometimes slippery so watch your step.</strong>)&nbsp;  If you are not comfortable with steep and slippery you can still reach Seven  Trees by doing the trail in reverse with a much gentler grade.&nbsp; From here  you have two choices.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Long Loop (7.25 miles, red on map):</strong>&nbsp; Turn right and  climb straight up the ridge to the Verdugo Motorway.&nbsp; This route has no  maintained trail and is only for the toughest among us.&nbsp; Turn left on the  Verdugo Motorway, passing Tongva Peak along the way, to a junction with the  Brand Motorway.&nbsp; Turn left and take this road back down to the parking  lot.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Short Loop (2.1 miles, green on map):</strong>&nbsp; From Seven  Trees take the road down to where it meets the Brand Motorway.&nbsp; If you  want more mileage take the Brand Motorway up to the crest or as far as you want  to go, returning the same way back to the parking lot.<br>
  <br>
  Whichever way you go everyone should take a short side trip to visit the  Brand Family Cemetary.&nbsp;There is a small sign pointing the  way to a few stone steps climbing up to the final resting place of the Brand  family including the family dogs.&nbsp;Leslie Brand himself is buried under  a very large impressive pyramid.<br>
  <br>
After the hike bring a chair or a  blanket and we will picnic on the grass of the Japanese Tea Garden located  across from the parking lot.</p>
