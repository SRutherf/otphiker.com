<p><strong>Hike #1452<br>
Three Points to Sulphur Springs Campground via the PCT<br>
August 25, 2021</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Dan Bergstrom</strong></p>
	
	<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Start times and cookies will be between 7:00 am and 8:30 am to accommodate all hikers.</font></strong></p>
	<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">The  start time will be optional.&nbsp; This isn't a loop hike so everyone will  cross paths at some time.&nbsp; Also the early birds can do an extra credit  hike on the Silver Moccasin Trail if they so desire after finishing the Sulfur  Springs hike. I will be there from 7am to 8:30am to accommodate everyone.&nbsp;  Accuweather has backed down a bit on their forecast so it may not be as hot as  earlier predicted.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.&nbsp; This will avoid the inconvenience and save costs to the hike leader.</strong></font></p>

<p><b>GPS Data:</b><br>
RT = 8.0 mi.<br>
Max elevation change = 1000 ft.</p>

<p><b>Trailhead Directions:</b>&nbsp; Drive north on Hwy 2 (Angeles Crest) from the 210 freeway past the Clear Creek Information Center to Sulphur Springs Road (3N17) which is about 2.5 miles past the Chilao Visitor Center turnoff.&nbsp; Turn left and proceed about 100' to the paved parking lot and park. &nbsp; There is a restroom at the parking lot.</p>

<p><b>The Hike:</b>&nbsp; We proceed northerly on the Pacific Crest Trail (starts uphill out of the parking lot opposite the entrance).&nbsp; The route descends through oak, manzanita and open chaperal.&nbsp; Bear right at the junction of the trail and the extension of the road out of Singing Pines Camp and continue north until reaching Sulpher Springs Road.&nbsp; Turn right and proceed into the campground for lunch.&nbsp; Return the same way.</p>

<p>Those hikers desiring a shorter hike can turn around whenever they wish.</p>

<p>Hikers should be aware that the Silver Mocasin Trail intersects the PCT adjacent to the parking lot.&nbsp; An alternate hike would be to follow the Silver Mocasin Trail west 3.0 mi. to Horse Flats campground.</p>
