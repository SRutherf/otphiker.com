September 27, 2017</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hike Leader: Rich Frederick</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meet at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>

<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
Crystal Lake to Windy Gap = 6.0 mi. RT; max. elev. = 1800 ft.<br>
Crystal Lake to Mt. Islip via Windy Gap (return by same route) = 7.8 mi. RT; max. elev. = 2530 ft.<br>
Crystal Lake to Mt. Islip via Windy Gap (return via Big Cienega trail) = 8.1 mi. RT; max. elev. = 2530 ft.<br>
Little Jimmy Loop = 0.9 mi. RT, max. elev. = -105 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to trailhead:</strong> On east I-210, exit Azusa Avenue (Highway 39).&nbsp; Go north through Azusa into San Gabriel Canyon. &nbsp; After 12 miles one passes the bridge to the East Fork Road.  Continue straight on Highway 39 for 12 more miles. &nbsp; Turn right into the signed entrance to Crystal Lake Recreation Area. &nbsp; Drive through the campground.&nbsp; Go ½ mile past the Snack Shop and Visitor Center to where there is a locked gate in front of you and the road forks in several directions. &nbsp; Park in the large dirt lot on the right.  Rest rooms are scattered throughout the area.</p>

<p><strong>The hike:</strong> The trail starts across from the parking area. &nbsp; The trailhead is signed “Windy Gap - 2.5 mi.” Windy Gap is the low point in the ridge in front of you. &nbsp; In 0.04 mile you cross a road heading to Deer Flats and South Hawkins. &nbsp; Continue on the trail and in 0.07 mile more you will again cross the South Hawkins road and continue on the signed trail.&nbsp; In 0.1 mi. one reaches a junction with the Big Cienega Cutoff Trail. &nbsp; Continue right on the main trail. In about 2.3 miles you will reach Windy Gap Saddle where there is always a cooling breeze.</p>  

<p>At this point there are choices to be made.&nbsp; Call it a hike, and return to the trailhead the way you came.&nbsp; Continue on to Little Jimmy Campground or Mt. Islip or Mt. Hawkins.&nbsp; At Mt. Islip you may either return to Windy Gap, or continue beyond the peak on a marginal trail via Big Cienega, ultimately intersecting the Windy Gap trail at the South Hawkins road.</p>
