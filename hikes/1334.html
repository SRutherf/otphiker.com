<p><strong>Hike #1334<br>
September 6, 2017<br> 
Crystal 
Cove Beach &amp; Trails</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Bob DeWolf</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meet at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>

<p><strong>Driving Directions:</strong> Take  the 55 Freeway South toward Newport Beach.&nbsp; Take the 73 toll road SE to  Macarthur Blvd.&nbsp; No toll is charged if you get off at Macarthur.&nbsp; Follow  Macarthur 2.1 miles S. to Pacific Coast Highway (PCH).&nbsp; Take PCH SE to Crystal  Cove.&nbsp; When you turn onto PCH you will see the signs to Crystal Cove (3 miles). &nbsp; Crystal Cove has a number of beachside parking lots on the right that come  first, and the El Moro parking lot on the left 1.8 miles beyond Newport Coast  Drive.&nbsp; Watch for the El Morro Elementary School.&nbsp; Turn left at  the stop light and drive past the school and make a left at the  stop sign.&nbsp; Refreshments will be at the picnic table at the top of the  small hill behind the restroom at the Visitor Center.&nbsp; The parking fee is  $14 for seniors.&nbsp; You can park  free if you have one of the special passes and many of us do.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> The high temperature is predicted to be in the low 80s.&nbsp; The predictions  are changing by the minute but I think a beach hike at reasonable temperatures  is very likely.&nbsp; At times the backcountry trails have been very hot at  this time of year, ignoring forecasts.&nbsp; The beach is the best choice but  if its cool at the trailhead you could consider a 4 mile loop on the trails in  the early morning followed by a 4 mile loop on the beach in the late  morning/early afternoon.&nbsp; You could walk 4 miles on the trails, thru the  tunnel and down to the Cottages and back for another 4 miles.<br>
<br>
Those who want to choose a short hike on the beach can join me and catch the  southbound bus ($.75 exact change) to Pelican Point Drive and walk back on the  beach with a possible stop at the Shake Shack.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Another beach hike that can be done is to head down to the tunnel and just do  an out and back on the beach for a longer hike.
