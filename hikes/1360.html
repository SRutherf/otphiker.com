<p><strong>The Hike: &nbsp;</strong>You will travel through  varied terrain, from canyon bottoms to high ridges.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
   <strong>Outside Loop:&nbsp;</strong> The outside loop goes up steeply 0.8 miles  from the trailhead on the Ahwingna Trail to a junction with the Native Oak  Trail.&nbsp; Go right on the Native Oak Trail.&nbsp; In 1.0 mile you will arrive at a  junction with the Puma Trail.&nbsp; Go right and continue on the Native Oak  Trail 1.2 miles to the top of the ridge to the trail which is at present  referred to as the Schabarum or the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic  Trail and formerly was known as the Skyline Trail.&nbsp; Turn left here and go  0.6 miles to a junction with the Coyote Trail.&nbsp; This is after you pass the  Ahwingna Trail turnoff on the left, and keep your eyes open for the Coyote Trail  sign a little ways in on your left.&nbsp; Go left 1.5 miles back to the parking lot.<br>
   <br>
   <strong>North Loop:&nbsp;</strong> The north loop goes right at the Ahwingna -  Native Oak Trail Junction 2.2 miles to the top of the ridge.&nbsp; Turn left  and in 0.5 miles you will reach the Ahwingna Trail.&nbsp; Turn left and then go  1.3 miles back to the parking lot.<br>
   <br>
   <strong>South Loop:&nbsp;</strong> The south loop goes left at the Ahwingna -  Native Oak Trail junction 0.5 miles up to the top of the ridge.&nbsp; A left  turn takes you in 0.1 miles to the Coyote Trail and then back to the parking  lot.<br>
   <br>
 <strong>Comprehensive Loop:&nbsp;</strong> The comprehensive hike (loop plus out/back  segment) follows the outside loop but adds the out/back segment along the  Schabarum trail at the ridge and along the chain-link fence.&nbsp; About 0.5 miles  after you start on the Schabarum trail from the Native Oak Trail, and shortly  before you reach the Ahwingna Trail on the left, there's a break in the  chain-link fence and you will see the water tank (the Rose Hills Turnbull  Canyon Water Tower), with lots of graffiti on it and surrounded by a chain link  fence, on your right.&nbsp; Head for this water tank by briefly going back along the  fire road on the opposite side of the fence and then climbing the pathway to  the tank.&nbsp; From there you will see the trail to at least two hills (moderate  elevation drop and gain).&nbsp; Go to perhaps the second one of these to eat your  lunch with an attractive panoramic view of the surroundings, and then return to  the fence opening to continue along the rest of the outside loop.&nbsp; This  excursion adds perhaps about 1.6 more miles to your hike and some elevation  gain.</p>
<p>There is a restroom at the trail head. &nbsp; Refreshments will be  close by.</p>
