<p><b>Description of the Hike:</b>&nbsp; There are a number of variations for this hike.&nbsp; The terrain is rolling hills going through fresh spring grass, Oak and Black Walnut Woodlands.&nbsp; Wild flowers may be in bloom at this time.&nbsp; Intermittent creeks parallel the trails in some areas.</p>

Exit at Azusa Ave. (exit #18) and go south to Colima; left on Colima; right into Schabarum Park.&nbsp; Drive straight past the guard booth and continue on the main park road (don't turn right).&nbsp; After about 0.6 mi. you will come to a "T" intersection. (Follow signs to Equestrian Area).&nbsp; Turn left and in another 0.2 mi. you will arrive at an equestrian area.&nbsp; Park on the right.&nbsp; Bathrooms and picnic tables are available at the park.</p>

<p><b>Basic Hike:</b>&nbsp; 6.3 miles, about 1300 feet total elevation gain – From the Schabarum Trailhead, head south on Powder Canyon Trail 0.8 miles to junction with the Black <u>Walnut</u> Trail on the left.&nbsp; Follow Black Walnut Trail 1.0 miles to turnoff to Nogales Trail (on the right).&nbsp; Take Nogales Trail a short .12 miles to join Powder Canyon Trail, which is a dirt road at this point.&nbsp; Right on Powder Canyon and continue for 0.8 miles to the junction (on the left) with the Purple Sage Trail.&nbsp; Go left and follow Purple Sage Trail for 0.9 miles.&nbsp; At the junction with Buena Vista Trail you will be facing a transmitter station above you.</p>
