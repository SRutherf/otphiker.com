<p>GPS Data:<br>

<p><strong>Directions to the Trailhead:&nbsp; </strong>From the West Valley, go north on Topanga Canyon Blvd., go under the 118 freeway and take a right turn onto Poema Place.&nbsp; From elsewhere, go west on the 118 freeway and exit on Topanga Canyon Blvd. in Chatsworth. At the end of the off-ramp, take a sharp right turn onto Poema Place.</p>
<p> Immediately past the first stop sign, there is a <a href="../images/1600_description/Devil's_Canyon_Refreshment_Area.jpg">landscaped park area</a> on your right. This is where we will have our post-hike refreshments. Park on either sides of the road. Alternately, drive another hundred yards  to a cross-walk. Park on either side of the street.&nbsp; The trailhead is a horsetrail on the north side of the street, next to the cross-walk. </p>
<p>There are no picnic tables in the refreshment area so please bring chairs. There are no restrooms at the trailhead.</p>
<p> <strong>The Hike:&nbsp; </strong>Go along the horsetrail up a slight rise. Take the left fork and travel along the east and north side of the condo complex.&nbsp; The trail will bend to the right and then to the left in a generally northerly direction. The trail is generally shaded with a slight elevation rise. In about 2.5 miles one comes to a dam. Follow the trail for as far as you want to go. Prior OTP hikers have gone as far as 5 miles before turning around for a 10 mile RT.&nbsp;</p>
