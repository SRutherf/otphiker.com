<p>Directions to Trailhead: We will assemble at the intersection of 28th St.  and Dell St. Go west on Washington Blvd. almost to the end (Venice Pier), turn  right on Dell and park near the first bridge you come to. Park on the street.  There is no restroom immediately available, but there is a public facility on  the beach adjacent to the pier which we will pass in another hour or so.<br>
  <br>
  The Hike: The first part of the hike is a self guided tour of the canals. We  will split into groups of 8-10 persons, descend  down the canal access off to one side of the bridge, and wander up and down the  canals noting the various architectures - modern pretentious (perhaps) new  structures together with the old original bungalows. Note how people have  landscaped their homes, the art they have chosen for their decorations. Check  out the birds which have decided to share their surroundings with the people. At  an agreed upon time, all groups will gather at the end of the Venice pier  (restroom available just south of the entrance to the pier).<br>
  <br>
  After gathering ourselves, we leave the pier and  turn to the right and  make our way south first along the beach (Ocean  Front Walk) as far as we can go, then shifting to the east by  one block to Speedway and continuing south on Speedway to Lighthouse street. <br>
  <br>
  At Lighthouse St., turn left (east) and cross the only bridge crossing the Grand Canal (now known  only as the Ballona  Lagoon). Turn right and continue south on  South Esplanade/Via Donte which runs&nbsp; between the east side of  the canal and some magnificant homes and condos.  Continue until reaching the dead end at Via Marina, turn left and walk down to  a little shaded park where Via Marina turns north into the Marina. This is a  nice place to eat lunch, and watch the boats entering and leaving the Marina.<br>
  <br>
  Continue north on Via Marina turning right on Tahiti Way. Go as far as you  can, then turn left through a gap between the buildings out to the dock access  lane. Turn left checking out all of the boats, and walk back toward Via Marina  and turn right. Proceed northward to the Marquesas Way and turn left following  Marquesas as it turns to the north and becomes Via Dolce. Continue up Via Dolce  to Washington Blvd., cross and continue on Dell back to the trailhead.<br>
  <br>
  Bring your own refreshments to consume at the trailhead.<br>

  History: Venice California originally was to be a copy of Venice, Italy,  canals and all. The original 16 miles of canals were dug in 1904 under the  direction of Abbot Kinney. Man and mule worked around the clock to dig the  canals in time for the grand opening of Venice on July 4, 1905. By the  twenties, the automobile had made its mark and was here to stay. The canals were  not practical for the horseless carriage. In 1929 the majority of the canals  were filled in and converted to roads.<br>
  <br>
In the sixties the canals were home to beatniks and artists, which soon gave  way to the hippies. Rock bands and pot parties were the norm. Jim Morrison of  The Doors called the canals home during the 60s. As real estate prices  skyrocketed in the late seventies, the houses along the canals were remodeled  and homes were built on the numerous vacant lots. Soon the affluent homeowners  replaced the artists and Bohemians. In 1994 after nearly thirty years of talks,  Los Angeles refurbished the six remaining canals for $6,000,000. Some of the  most beautiful homes on Los Angeles' West Side line the canals maintaining a  unique community atmosphere. The canals today provide a sense of serenity that  Venetians and tourists alike greatly appreciate.</p>
