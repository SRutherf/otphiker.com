  <h3><b>Aliso & Wood Canyons Wilderness Park</b></h3></center></p

><p>Distance: Basic hike = 8 miles.<br>
Elevation gain: 800 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead:  From the 405 there is a long and a short route depending on whether you're too cheap to pay the $3.50 toll on the 73.<br>
The <b>LONG</b> way is: from the 405 Freeway, take Irvine Center Drive south, which becomes Moulton Parkway after a few miles. Turn right on Glenwood Drive, which crosses over the 73 and becomes Pacific Park. Take the first right on Canyon Vistas. Drive to the bottom of the hill and park on the street. The Wilderness Park is accessed through the city park.</p>

<p>The <b>SHORT</b> way is: Take the 405 to the 73 and exit on Glenwood Drive / Pacific Park. (Interestingly, the older Thomas Guides don't show an exit from the 73 to Pacific Park, but it's there.) Turn right on Pacific Park and promptly turn right on Canyon Vistas. Drive to the bottom of the hill and park on the street.</p>

<p>From the 5, get off at the El Toro Road exit and turn right on El Toro Road. Shortly turn left on Moulton Parkway and continue as under LONG above.</p>

<p>There is a portapotty in the park.

<p>The Hike: All hikes begin by walking through the city park to the entrance. Stay to
the right in the City Park. After walking in the Wilderness Park a short distance we come to a bench and poster board, and a fork in the trail.</p>

<p>The long hike: Turn right on Cholla Tr., continue on West Ridge Trail all the way to the end for a  panoramic view of Catalina, Palos Verdes, the San Gabriels, and San Clemente Island (I think). The return is back down West Ridge Trail to Mathis Canyon Trail. The connection to Wood Canyon Trail is tricky due to a trail washout. One can take Dripping
Cave trail to Wood Cyn. Tr., turn left and return, or walk around the barrier fence and along the trail above the creek to Wood Cyn. Tr. Return on Wood Cyn. Tr. or Coyote Run Tr.,
which is parallel.</p>

<p>Shorter hikes: There are several. Simply walking the Wood Canyon trail all the way to Aliso Creek Trail and back would give one about 8 miles with only 400 feet total gain and the pleasure of walking in a wooded canyon. One could also take a side trip from Wood
Canyon Trail up to Moulton Peak for another Panoramic view.</p>

<p>Refreshments in the city park. Glass bottles and alcohol is prohibited, so all beverages will be in cans and innocuous-appearing plastic cups will be provided.
