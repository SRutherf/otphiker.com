<center><h3><b>Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall Hike</b></h3></center></p>

<p>This will be a six and a half mile loop hike with less than 500 feet elevation gain or loss from Point Vicente Park/Civic Center to an area the OTPers have never visited.  There is enough macho stuff to please everyone, maybe!  If the weather cooperates, the shoreline and ocean views are majestic.</p>

<p>We will begin by exploring an Old Nike Site, then head down past a Japanese farmer’s cactus and flower farm.  We’ll hike further down to the area around the former Marineland site, then continue our loop west to the Ocean Front trail and back up to the Civic Center.  We’ll need to stick together on this hike so we don’t lose anyone, which seems to have been happening a lot lately!</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions:</p>

<p>From the 405 Freeway take Hawthorne Boulevard South up and over “The Hill” past Crest Rd. (Ralph’s Market), Robert Ryan Park on the right, Vallon Drive and past Crestmont (Salvation Army headquarters) on the left.  At the very next possible place to turn left turn into the parking lot for Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall (Point Vincent Park and Civic Center).  Park in the parking lot furthest away from the entrance. If you miss the left turn into the above noted parking lot, continue on down to the traffic light at the bottom of the hill, flip a “U” and come back up.</p>

<p>From the 110 Freeway go south to the Pacific Coast Hwy off-ramp and head west.  Turn left when you come to Hawthorne Blvd. and follow the directions listed above.</p>

<p>Note: There is one Port-A-Potty at the park.</p>
