<center><h3><b>Shortcut Canyon to West Fork Campground</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 6 miles round trip.<br>
Elevation gain = -1800 ft. (You must climb out to get back to the trailhead)</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Drive to Shortcut Saddle, 19 miles from La Canada on the Angeles Crest Hwy. Park in the clearing on the left (north) side of the highway, about 1/4 mile east of the Shortcut picnic area.  Shortcut Saddle is just beyond the intersection of Angeles Crest Hwy. and Upper Big Tujunga Canyon Road.</p>

<p>The Hike: We start by going south on the Shortcut Canyon Trail. When reach a fire road (after several short switchbacks), we turn right to follow the road some 200 yards until we again pick up the trail on the left and drop steeply down to the East Fork of Shortcut Canyon. We continue going down the canyon making a number of stream crossings until after about 3 miles, we reach the West Fork of the San Gabriel River.</p>

<p>The West Fork Campground is located on the south side of the river requiring further boulder bounding to reach it. This is where we will eat our lunch, taking advantage of the campground picnic tables and toilets. Return the way we came.

<p>Should someone desire a shorter hike, it will be a matter of turning around early and returning to the start point.</p>
