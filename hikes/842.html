<p>GPS Data:<br>
Loop around the park = 2.6 mi.
PCT Extension = 3.7 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain = 350 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to trailhead: Take 405 north.  Merge into I-5.  Take SR 14 toward Lancaster. Leave the 14 freeway at Aqua Dulce exit.  Head north toward Aqua Dulce.  Just short of Aqua Dulce the road takes a sharp right.  Turn Right.  The main road turns north again, but keep going east.  Do not go into the town.  The parking area and trailhead will be on the right.</p>

<p>The Hike: We will hike through the park and come back on the same route which will yield the 4 miles RT. The Pacific Crest Trail runs through the park, under the freeway and beyond. Where possible we will follow it as far as one wishes before turning around.</p>

<p>Refreshments will be enjoyed near the parking area.</p>
