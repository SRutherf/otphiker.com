<center><h3><b>Chantry Flat - Various Destinations</b></h3></center></p>

<p>There are many hike choices from this trailhead:</p>

<p>It could be an out and back to one of the camps along Gabrielino Trail and return.  Example: Return from Spruce Grove = 7 miles round trip.  Or, turn around sooner.<br>
It could be a longer loop trip up to Sturdevant Campground then onto Mount Zion and return via Upper or Lower Winter Creek trails, 8-9 miles.<br>
It could be a shorter loop from Roberts Camp along Lower Winter Creek to Hoegees and return via Upper Winter Creek. 5.1 miles<br>
It could be a long out and back on the Santa Anita Ridge Trail (7-8 miles), or even a longer 9 mile trek extending from the ridge along the Olene Ridge and back via Upper Winter Creek.<br>
Or it could be a shorter descent to Hermit Falls starting from the "First Water" trail turnoff, 3 miles.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 210 FREEWAY east to SANTA ANITA AVENUE exit (turns into Santa Anita Canyon road) and drive north to Chantry Flats, about 5-6 miles.  Park in the upper large lot.  Signed trailhead is across the road. Don't forget Forestry parking pass.

<p>Weather and altitude thoughts: Chantry = 2,220 feet,  Mt. Zion = 3,575 feet,  Spruce Grove = 3,100 feet,
Hoegees = 2,500 feet,  Sturtevant = 3,240 feet.  Hopefully all below snow level, but wouldn’t it be nice to see some?</p>
