<center><h3><b>Tunnels to Nowhere</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 5.5 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain: 900 ft.</p>

<p>History: From a posting from Benjamin Simpson http://blog.hodomania.com: “The tunnels in the hills above the Bridge to Nowhere, they were built in the 60’s as an escape route for a nuclear holocaust, but once they got two of the tunnels built they couldn’t figure out how to continue forward, so they brought over some Swiss engineers, and they confirmed that there was no way forward. The San Gabriel Mountains are littered with failed engineering works.”</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions:  From the I-210 Freeway, in Azusa, turn north on, Azusa Avenue, SR-39.  Azusa Avenue becomes San Gabriel Canyon Road at the north side of Azusa.  Follow San Gabriel Canyon Road up the canyon, past the two dams.  Above the second reservoir turn right on the East Fork Road.  Proceed 3.4 miles to Shoemaker Canyon Road on your left.  Turn up Shoemaker Canyon Road and continue about 1.8 miles.  Park off the road near the locked gate or in the large parking area nearby.  </p>

<p>The Hike:  We will hike on a dirt road high up above the Narrows of the East Fork of the San Gabriel River.  We will be able to see, below us, the parking area for the hike to the Bridge to Nowhere and as we proceed we will have views overlooking the river.  About 1.7 miles up the trail we will reach the first tunnel, about 400 yards long.  Another tunnel, about 250 yards long, lies beyond.  With a bit of luck we may even see a few big horn sheep on the mountain slope across the river.</p>
