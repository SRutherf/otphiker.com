<br>
<strong>Directions to  Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;From the 210 Freeway take the Michillinda Blvd. off-ramp, in Arcadia, and go  north on Michillinda.&nbsp; After about 1.2 miles turn right (east) at Grandview.&nbsp; Turn left (north) at the  third street, Grove. Grove will dead-end at Bailey Canyon Park.&nbsp; Go  through the gate and park in the parking lot.&nbsp; If the lot is full there is  plenty of parking along Grove just before the park entrance. There is a  restroom in the park.<br>
<br>
<strong>Basic Hike:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and back on the Bailey Canyon Trail to Jones  Peak.&nbsp; It is not an easy hike, it is steep, but the trail is in good  condition.<br>
<br>
<strong>Connector Trail Loop Option:&nbsp;</strong> From the saddle below  Jones Peak head north a quarter mile to the junction of the Connector  trail.&nbsp; Take that down almost a mile to  the Wilson trail turn right and head down to the Mount Wilson Trail Park.&nbsp; Go west on Carter Ave about 0.75 miles to the  Bailey Canyon trail parking.<br>
<br>
<strong>Jones Ridge Loop Option:</strong>&nbsp; Exit the parking lot and walk 0.75 miles  east along Carter Avenue to the beginning of the Mt. Wilson Trail.&nbsp; Hike  up the trail about a mile to the unmarked junction of the Jones Ridge Route  Trail.&nbsp; The trail route follows the ridge all the way to the summit of  Jones Peak.&nbsp; The lower part of the trail has easy switchbacks for a while,  but then it is a straight up scramble about a mile and 1,735 feet elevation  gain.&nbsp; Return via the Bailey Canyon Trail back down to the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Shorter Options:</strong><br>
  1) Hike up the Bailey Canyon trail for 2.2 miles (one way) and 1,350 feet  elevation gain to the Old Cabin site.&nbsp; All that is left of the cabin are  some low stone walls.&nbsp; It is shady there and a short trail leads down to  the stream with lots of trees.<br>
  2) Hike up the Canyon View Nature Trail, which goes to the falls.&nbsp; This  trail branches off the Bailey Trail after 0.45 miles with a total distance to  the falls one way from the Park of about 0.75 miles and 300 feet gain.<br>
  3) Another short loop that could be combined with the Falls Trail is the Live  Oak Nature Trail, which begins by crossing a bridge 0.3 miles from the Park.
