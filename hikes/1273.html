Hike #1273<br>
Las Virgenes Preserve (Ahmanson Ranch) - Northern Trails<br>
May 11, 2016</p>

<p>Vicky Ritter, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
RT = 6.4 mi.<br>
Elevation gain = 670 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: For those in the Valley area, take Victory Blvd. westbound to the trailhead.</p>

<p>For those traveling from the south, take the northbound Ventura (101) Fwy., exit Valley Circle Blvd. Turn right (north) and go approximately 2 miles to Victory Blvd. Turn left and go approximately 1 mile to the trailhead.</p>

<p>Parking fee is $3.00 per vehicle. Alternatively, park on Victory Blvd. and walk up to the trailhead. Restroom facility consists of one Andy Gump.</p>

<p>The Hike: In the past we have hiked west and south. This time we will hike north towards Bell Canyon and west to make a counter clockwise loop. We climb up in elevation and have beautiful views of the valley, Bell Canyon and the surrounding mountains.</p>  

<p>About half of the trail is not shown on maps but can be seen on Google Earth type displays. There are many trails and one has to follow the right one to make the loop. Therefore, it is recommended that those with GPS devices download the gpx file by right-clicking (control-click on a MAC) on <a href="../aerialphotomaps/LasVirgenesPreserveHike.gpx" ><b>Download</b></a>) and choose “Save Link As...” to save the document to your computer. Alternatively, they can program their device with the critical waypoints given below. It is recommended that hikers then follow those hikers so equipped.</p> 

<p>Refreshments will be at the trailhead.</p>
