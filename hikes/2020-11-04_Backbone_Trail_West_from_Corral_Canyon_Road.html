Additional options 1.25 RT<br>

<p><strong>Directions: </strong> Head west on the 101. Turn left at Las  Virgenes Canyon Road.&nbsp; Turn right on Pacific Coast Highway.&nbsp; After 2.4 miles,  turn right onto Corral Canyon Road. Drive 5.5 miles until the road turns to  gravel.&nbsp; Continue another 0.1 miles to the dirt parking lot on the left.&nbsp; There  is no parking fee and no restrooms.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>General: </strong> The hike is mostly in the Upper Solstice  Canyon and is the longest stretch of riparian woodlands on the entire Backbone  Trail, with plenty of shade and creek crossings.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Hike:&nbsp; </strong>Locate the trailhead at the west end of the  parking lot, that is signed &ldquo;Backbone Trail, Corral Canyon Trailhead.&rdquo; Take the  single-track trail.<br>
  <br>
  At 0.45 miles the single-track trail joins a gravel road.  Turn right. After a minute, the road joins another dirt road in a T junction.  Continue straight, on the single-track trail. <br>
  <br>
  At 0.72 miles, the trail crosses a stream. A seasonal 20-foot  waterfall lies just upstream to the right.<br>
  <br>
  At 2.5 miles, the trail becomes steep, rocky, and slippery  at a large slab of blue/grey sandstone. Turn right at the T-junction.<br>
  <br>
  At 2.67 miles, you reach Newton Motorway, a saddle between  Castro Peak and Little Castro Peak (aka Obert Peak). Turn around and return to  the trailhead. An option is to turn left and climb clockwise around to the top  of Little Castro Peak for an additional 0.5-mile RT. <br>
  <br>
  Upon returning to the Corral Canyon trailhead, a further  option is to continue east along the Backbone Trail to some nearby impressive  rock formations. 0.75 miles RT.<br>
