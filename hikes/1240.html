<p>Hike #1240<br>
Point Vicente to the Terranea Resort & Return<br>
August 26, 2015<br>

<p>Larry Savell, Hike Leader</p.

<p>Directions to the Trailhead: From the 405 Freeway take Hawthorne Boulevard SOUTH, up and over “The Hill” to the end of Hawthorne Blvd. at Palos Verdes Drive West. TURN LEFT at the traffic light (where you’ll find a “Starbucks” for coffee). Turn right at the next turn off, which will be the entrance to Point Vicente Interpretive Center, and park in the parking lot. Note: There are restrooms available at the park, after 9am. </p>

<p>If you take the 110 Freeway go South to the Pacific Coast Hwy off-ramp and head West.  Turn left when you come to Hawthorne Blvd. and follow the directions listed above.</p>

<p>Our hike will begin at 9:30AM at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center. Located next to Point Vicente Lighthouse, this small natural history museum is an ideal whale-watching spot although at this time of year the whale migration is past. But you never know what you might see playing out in the ocean. The many exhibits highlight the peninsula's geology, flora and fauna.</p>

<p>The hike will take us east along the coastal cliffs of Palos Verdes in the city of Rancho Palos Verdes. If the weather cooperates, the shoreline and ocean views are magnificent and we might be able to get a great view of Catalina Island. We will follow a path that takes us along Palos Verdes Drive South where we will connect to the Terranea Resort trail. 
We continue hiking along the trail where we hike past the ruins of the Marineland pier at Long Point and should see some sea lions sunning themselves on an outcrop. The trail continues until we reach the Terranea beach. This is about 1½ miles. This would be a great place to have a cookie break and admire the view and the surf. Some hikers will turn back here. The trail continues here up to the Terranea cliff trail and goes east to Abalone Cove about another 1.7 miles. You can explore the beach at Abalone Cove and make your way back to Point Vincente along PV Drive South or just reverse you trail back through Terraea.</p>

<p>Alternate hikes: Near the beginning of the hike we will enter a parking lot just before Terranea trail in which you can take a side trip down the ramp to the beach/rocks and enjoy the surf. Also, other adventurous hikers can hike through the Terranea grounds or even stop at a Terranea restaurant for lunch. You can also go east as far or near along the Point Vincente trail as you like and turn back anywhere.</p>
