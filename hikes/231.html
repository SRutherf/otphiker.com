<center><h3><b>Bear Creek via Smith Mountain Saddle</b></h3></center></p>

<p>NOTE: This is a shuttle Hike</p>

<p>Distance: (Principal Hike) = 11 miles<br>
Elevation gain:	970 feet<br>
Elevation loss:	2675 feet</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions:</p>

<p>From the I-210 freeway, in Azusa, turn north on Azusa Avenue, SR-39.  Allow at least 25 minutes driving time from the freeway.  We will meet 11.5 miles from the freeway in the parking lot at the West Fork of the San Gabriel River.  We will leave some of the cars at this parking lot and we will share rides in the other cars to the trailhead, about six miles up the canyon.  We will park in the parking area on the west (left) side of the road about 1/4 mile before Coldbrook Campground.  A metal sign used to mark the Bear Creek Trail, it may be gone now.</p>

<p>Plan to arrive at the West Fork parking area before 9:00 AM. We will leave for the trailhead at 9:15 AM sharp.  If you are late and we have already left, you may drive to the trailhead and attempt to catch up with us, or you may hike up the West Fork and then up Bear Creek to meet us coming out (see option 2 below).</p>

<p>The Hike:</p>

<p>The principal hike will be into the edge of the San Gabriel Wilderness along Bear Creek and ending at the West Fork of the San Gabriel River.  The beginning of this hike is six miles from the end so a car shuttle will be required.  The hike includes four miles of rock hopping and a few stream crossings but the trail is quite passable with a bit of effort and ingenuity.  If you take this part of the trip you should wear shoes that you don’t mind getting wet.  It would also be convenient to have dry shoes in your car for the trip home.</p>

<p>We will hike west, three miles, gaining 970 feet of elevation to Smith Saddle.  For the peak baggers an indistinct trail leads south, about 1/2 mile and 800 foot elevation gain, to the peak of Smith Mountain. Return to the saddle.</p>

<p>From Smith Saddle we will continue three more miles, and 1650 foot elevation loss, down to Bear Creek.  (A side trip, at this point, requires only a short walk of about 1/4 mile (north) up Bear Creek to see a waterfall).  We proceed four miles (south) down Bear Creek rock-hopping over a frequently obscure trail, losing 960 foot elevation.</p>

<p>Bear Creek empties into the West Fork of the San Gabriel River where a bridge crosses the river.  Climb out of the creek bed and onto the bridge, and it is a one mile stroll on the West Fork road to the parking area and the post hike festivities.</p>  

<p>Those who are interested in a shorter hike can turn back after three miles at Smith Saddle, resulting in a six mile round trip.  Drive back to the West Fork road parking area for the after hike party.</p>

<p>Other hike options:<br>
1) Starting from the West Fork road parking area, hike up the road to bridge over Bear Creek, then hike north along the creek to meet the main group. Turn around at this point and accompany them back out to the road.<br>
2) Another choice is to hike up the West Fork road along the river for a couple of hours then return to the parking area join in the post hike festivities<br>
3) If you wish to bring a bicycle, you can easily ride up the West Fork road to Cogswell Dam (16 miles round trip).<br>
4) You could also bring fishing tackle and spend the day fishing along the river.  The river above the first bridge is a catch and release area.</p>
