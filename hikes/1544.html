 <br>
<b>Directions to Trailhead:</b>&nbsp; Take the 210 freeway east and exit on Baseline Rd.&nbsp; As you exit, turn left and then right on Padua Rd (first road to the right).&nbsp; Follow this road north which joins Mt. Baldy Rd.&nbsp; Go 1.5 miles past Mt. Baldy Village to Icehouse Canyon Resort.&nbsp; For those who want to drive a more familiar way, exit Mountain Ave. which also joins Mt. Baldy Road.&nbsp; There are radar/camera enforced speed limits in Mt. Baldy Village.
<p><b>The Hike:</b>&nbsp; The trail leads east along the floor of the canyon.&nbsp; The path stays close to the oak and spruce-shaded creek and passes some cabins.&nbsp; After 0.8 miles, the trail forks and we continue straight ahead (right fork) on the shorter but somewhat steeper Icehouse Canyon Trail directly up the canyon.&nbsp; The trail climbs up the north slope of the canyon, before dropping down again and crossing the creek.&nbsp; The Chapman Trail intersects with the up-canyon trail and the combined trail ascends a steep 0.75 mile to the top of Icehouse Saddle.

<p><b><s>Option 1:</s></b><s>&nbsp; Chapman Loop:&nbsp; At 1.0 miles, take the left fork, Chapman Trail to Cedar Glen Campsite.&nbsp; Continue on the Chapman Trail to where it intersects with the Icehouse Canyon Trail and continue up to the saddle.</s></p>

<p><b>Option 2:</b>&nbsp; For those who wish a shorter hike, a hike to the Cedar Glen Campsite and back is recommended.</p>

<p><b>Option 3:</b>&nbsp; For those who want to hike a little further, take the Three T's Trail from the saddle to Timber Mountain.</p>
