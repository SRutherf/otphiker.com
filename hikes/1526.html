<p> <strong>Basic Hike (Green track):</strong>&nbsp;From Red Box, crossing Angeles Crest Highway, walk  east along the north shoulder of Angeles Crest Highway to the trailhead  slanting left up the hillside. Continue up the trail above Angeles Crest  Highway for 0.6 miles where the trail turns to the left. From there the trail  switchbacks up through chaparral as the trail contours around Mt. Lawler to the  northwest. Continue gradually up the trail 2.2 miles to Lawler Saddle on the  northwest shoulder of Mt. Lawlor. Here marks 550 feet in elevation gain, and it  may be a good place for a break before continuing up to Strawberry Peak or the  other options. For a shorter &ldquo;basic&rdquo; hike return on the same trail back to Red  Box or continue north on the main trail and return when ready.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Summit Climb Section (Yellow track):</strong> To get to the summit of Strawberry Peak from the Lawler Saddle;  leave the main trail and take an old firebreak slanting left along an  undulating, chaparral covered ridge. First hike north and then gradually the  trail heads west toward Strawberry&rsquo;s peak with Coulter pines and big cone  Douglas firs. Enjoy the views and then return the same way to Red Box. The summit  is 1.1 miles from Lawler Saddle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <strong>Options:&nbsp;</strong>The following options require shuttling cars  before the start of the hike leaving cars at the ending trailhead and shuttle  to Red Box before and after the hike. Add ~2.2 miles if Strawberry Peak summit  is included. Each of these options will include ~450 of elevation loss.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Option 1 (Blue track):  </strong>From the Lawler Saddle continue north on the main trail about 1.8 miles, passing  Strawberry Spring along the way, to a trail intersection. Take the trail leading  to the left (west) crossing through Strawberry Potrero. From here it is 3.1  miles to Josephine Saddle. Take the trail around Strawberry Peak to Josephine  Saddle where the Colby Canyon Trail intersects. Take Colby Canyon south 2.2  miles down to Angeles Crest Highway. Total mileage is 9.5. </p>
  <p><strong>Option 2 (Red track):  </strong>Same as Option 1 except at Josephine Saddle continue west 0.5 miles across Josephine  Saddle to the intersection with the fire road that leads south 2.4 miles down to  Clear Creek. Total mileage is 10.2.</p>
