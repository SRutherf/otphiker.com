<p>Hike #1220<br>
April 8, 2015<br>
Fish Canyon & Falls</p>

<p>Alice Weiss, Leader</p>

<p>Distance = Approx. 5 miles round trip, elevation gain = 900 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 210 freeway east toward Duarte from which ever way you need to and transition to the north-bound 605 freeway. The 605 ends at Huntington Drive. Turn right (east) on Huntington Dr. In about 0.4 mi, Huntington Dr. transitions to off to the south. Watch for La Lomas road crossing Huntington Dr. About 0.1 mile <b>past</b> Las Lomas road is Encanto Parkway coming in from the left (rock sign is in the middle of the Parkway). Turn left on Encanto Parkway (eventually becomes Fish Canyon road) and follow the road to the end, about 1 mile past the museum, and park. At the end of the road there will be 3 gates. The parking lot is thru the middle gate. There is room for about 40 cars, however there are NO seats anywhere, so bring your own chairs.</p>

<p>The Hike: The trail begins at the far north end of the lot. It's a great path and fenced in to keep us under control and away from Azusa Rock quarry operations. Eventually we leave the fenced area and follow a trail, it would be wise to use hiking sticks beyond this point.</p>
