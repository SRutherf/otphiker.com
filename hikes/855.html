<p>Distance: 7 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain = 900 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park is at 3600 Reseda Blvd. Tarzana, CA 91365.  From the 101, get off at Reseda Blvd. and go south for 3.2 mi.  You'll pass Ventura Blvd., Braemar Country Club, and some gated-community houses.  Reseda Blvd. dead-ends at the park, so it's hard to get lost.  Parking is curbside and costs $3.00 close to the turnaround, but you can park further down the street for free. There are two Andy Gumps at the turn around and potable water where we'll have refreshments.</p>

<p>The Hike: We will hike up the dirt road extension of Reseda Blvd. from Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park. Upon reaching Mulholland, turn right and walk along Mulholland Dr. a few hundred feet to the entrance of Fire Road 30.  There is a locked gate across the road, but a big "30" is painted on the right gate post so you'll know the start of Fire Road 30.</p>

<p>Walk 0.5 mile along Fire Road 30 and the sign "Garapito Canyon Trail 2.5 mi." will be on the right.  Fire Road 30 starts out descending, and then starts ascending.  The sign is at this change of elevation, so look for the sign at this point.  It is not all that big (a biker had to point it out).</p>

<p>Garapito is a very pleasant trail, much like the Musch Trail out of Trippet Ranch Park.  It is shaded, and the overgrowth has been recently cut back.  The trail ends at a "T" with another fire road.  Go left at this "T" for 0.8 mi. to Hub Junction and Fire Road 30. This is a good place to eat lunch. After lunch, turn left at the Hub on Fire Road 30 to return to the trailhead.</p>

<p>For those wanting a longer hike, turn right at the "T" and go the Eagle Peak for lunch (adds 0.5 mile total, over and back). After lunch, retrace your steps and continue past the "T" to the Hub, and Fire Road 30, turn left and return to the trailhead.</p>

<p>Refreshments served at the Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park trailhead.</p>
