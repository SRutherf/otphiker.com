<p><b>History:</b>&nbsp; According to "Trails of the Angeles," Orchard Camp was the site of the Halfway House since it was located halfway between Sierra Madre and Mt. Wilson.&nbsp; It was used as a construction camp for the Mt. Wilson Trail around 1864 the trail that was used to transport the materials for Harvard’s Mt. Wilson Observatory.&nbsp; Orchard Camp was closed in 1940 and only foundations remain.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp; </strong>Take the 210 Freeway to the Baldwin Avenue off ramp in Arcadia.&nbsp; For those coming from the east, the Baldwin Ave. off-ramp puts you directly on Baldwin Ave. going north. For those coming from the west, the off-ramp puts on Baldwin Ave.&nbsp; Turn left into the center lane of Baldwin Ave., continuing this way under the freeway bridge.&nbsp; At this point, Baldwin appears to end on Foothill Blvd.&nbsp; Turn left (there is a sign with an arrow) into the right lane of Foothill Blvd. and proceed (now going west), then turn right on the first street which is the continuation of Baldwin Ave.&nbsp; Proceed north on Baldwin to Mira Monte and turn right. Proceed to the trailhead at Mt. Wilson Drive.&nbsp; Park on the street around the Mira Monte Park where we will have refreshments after the hike.&nbsp; Seating may be limited so bring some chairs.&nbsp; There is a restroom at the park.</p>

<p><b>The Basic Hike:</b> The hike is straight up 3.5 miles to Orchard Camp on the Mount Wilson Trail and back down.</p>

<p><b>Option 1:</b>&nbsp; First Water.&nbsp; This is not a loop hike and there are many places along the trail to stop and turn around.&nbsp; The first scenic spot is at about 1.5 miles where the trail splits.&nbsp; The main trail goes to the left and a trail to the right drops down to a beautiful streamside location.</p>

<p><b>Option 2:</b>&nbsp; Alternate route to Orchard Camp.&nbsp; At the streamside from Option 1 continue on the trail along the stream.&nbsp; That trail is usually not in good condition.&nbsp; In about one half mile after a steep climb it rejoins the main trail.&nbsp; This option is better used coming back from Orchard Camp.</p>

<p><b>Option 3:</b>&nbsp; Last Water.&nbsp; To add another mile and 850 feet elevation gain continue up the Mount Wilson Trail out of Orchard Camp.&nbsp; The trail climbs steadily and then descends in the final approach to the creek and the canyon bottom.</p>

<p><b>Option 4:</b>&nbsp; Mount Wilson.&nbsp; Continue with option 3 to trail's end at Mt. Wilson - approx. 14 miles total RT from the trailhead, max. elevation about 4000 ft.</p>
