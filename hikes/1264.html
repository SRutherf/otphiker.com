<p>Hike #1264<br>
Chantry Flat Winter Creek Loop<br>
March 9, 2016</p>

<p>Wendell Suzuki, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data: (See Below)</p>

<p>There are many hike choices from this trailhead: It could be an out and back to one of the camps along Gabrielino Trail and return. Example: Return from Spruce Grove or turn around sooner.<br>
It could be a longer loop trip up to Sturdevant Campground then onto Mount Zion and return via Upper or Lower Winter Creek trails.<br>
It could be a shorter loop from Roberts Camp along Lower Winter Creek to Hoegee Campground and return via Upper Winter Creek.<br>
It could be a long out and back on the Santa Anita Ridge Trail, or even a longer trek extending from the ridge along the Olene Ridge and back via Upper Winter Creek.<br>
Or it could be a shorter descent to Hermit Falls starting from the "First Water" trail turnoff.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the 210 FREEWAY east to SANTA ANITA AVENUE exit (turns into Santa Anita Canyon road) and drive north to Chantry Flats, about 5-6 miles. Park in the upper large lot. Signed trailhead is across the road. Restroom facility is available. Don't forget Forestry parking pass.</p> 

<p>Weather and altitude thoughts: Chantry = 2,220 feet, Mt. Zion = 3,575 feet, Spruce Grove = 3,100 feet, Hoegees = 2,500 feet, Sturtevant = 3,240 feet. Hopefully all below snow level, but wouldn’t it be nice to see some?</p>
