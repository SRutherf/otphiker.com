<b>Hike #1340<br>

</b><br>
<b>Solstice Canyon &amp; Deer Valley Loop Trails</b><br>
<br>
<strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Peter Wall</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meet at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>

<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
Basic Hike:&nbsp; RT = 3.4 mi. and 770 ft. elevation gain.<br>
Deer Valley Loop:&nbsp; RT = 7.2 mi. and 1880 ft. elevation gain.<br>
Dry Canyon:&nbsp; RT = 1 mi. and 130 ft. elevation gain.<br>
<br>
<strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>&nbsp; Turn north off of Pacific Coast Highway at Corral  Canyon Road, which is 2.5 miles west of Malibu Canyon Road.&nbsp; Within a couple of  hundred yards turn left through the gate and continue straight into Solstice  Canyon Park.&nbsp; The parking lot is about half a mile from PCH. Parking is free and  there are restrooms.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Hike:</strong> We head up the canyon road and veer left onto the trail near the  picnic table and large oak.&nbsp; The trail crosses the road just before a bridge and  after a couple hundred yards turns sharply right, at a green metal fence post. &nbsp; We climb eastward on the TRW Loop Trail and soon arrive at the foundations of  two buildings, which were used by TRW between 1961 and 1973 to test spacecraft  magnetometers.&nbsp; Both buildings burned to the ground in the 2007 Corral Canyon  Fire.<br>
<br>
Follow the trail across the pavement and up the ridge.&nbsp; Walking out the El Nido  spur will give a good view of Corral Canyon and add 0.25 miles and 100 feet to  the numbers stated above.<br>
<br>
Continue up the steep Rising Sun Trail eventually getting to a long descending  leg taking us to the ruins of Robert's Ranch House which was built in 1952.&nbsp; It  featured exotic animals, several fireplaces, a bomb shelter, and a stone path  that leads upstream to a waterfall.&nbsp; It must have been quite a party place, as it  was seized as a part of drug convictions in the 70s.&nbsp; The place burned in 1982. &nbsp; Be sure to explore the ruins of the house, all of the stone work, the water  fall and the grotto across the stream.<br>
<br>
At this point one can return to the trailhead by walking the Solstice Canyon  Trail or can take the Sostomo Trail up and out of the canyon.&nbsp; On returning via  the Solstice Canyon Trail, note the stone house ruins located across from the  road, accessible by a new bridge.&nbsp; This was built by Henry Keller as a hunting cabin  in 1903, and was the first stone house built in the Santa Monicas. Although it  survived many fires, it was finally destroyed in the 2007 Corral Fire.<br>
<br>
The Sostomo Trail begins 0.1 miles below Robert's Ranch House.&nbsp; At the first  stream crossing, make sure you cross the stream, not try to follow it stream  upward.&nbsp; The foliage is heavy enough to preclude panoramic views of the canyon  or ocean. You will pass a couple of old rock cabins that are worth a few  moments of inspection.<br>
<br>
The Deer Valley Loop Trail may be hiked in either direction.&nbsp; The easterly  portion of the loop features some relatively flat meadow like areas, whereas,  the westerly part is a bit higher and has a grand panorama of the Pacific.&nbsp; Near  the southern end of the loop make sure you make the sharp bend, so that you  don?t end up in Latigo Canyon.<br>
<br>
The Dry Canyon Trail starts below the Trailhead complex and runs 0.5 mile to a  dead end at the vertical cliff supporting a number of houses (including the  &quot;Darth Vader&quot; house).<br>
