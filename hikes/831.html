<center><h3><b>Dead Horse Trailhead to Saddle Peak Road</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 11.5 miles RT<br> 
Elevation gain: 1200 ft.</p>
 
<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take Topanga Canyon Road from either direction. From PCH, the Topanga State Park turn-off is a right turn off from Topanga Canyon Road about a quarter of a mile past Topanga Village/Old Topanga Road. From the Valley, watch for a small brown sign announcing Topanga State Park on the right side of Topanga Canyon Road. Be alert for a sharp left turn, almost reversing directions, shortly past the sign. Proceed up the hill to the Dead Horse parking lot. There is a fee required and there are restrooms.</p>
 
<p>The Hike: The trailhead is behind the toilet. Follow the trail down to Topanga Canyon Road and cross carefully. Proceed up Green Leaf Canyon Road. After crossing the bridge, the trail begins again on the left (behind the trash bins). Proceed up the trail until you see a series of numbered stakes. As you pass stake #9, take the left hand trail. Follow this trail being aware that you will be passing a school - on your left going, right returning.</p>

<p>Near the end of this segment the trail goes through an amphitheatre and ultimately reaches a service road, cross the road, pick up the trail on the other side and continue down to Old Topanga Road and carefully cross. The trail picks up again directly across Old Topanga Road. Follow the trail to Saddle Peak Road and lunch. Return to the trailhead the way you came.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: When returning and you have reached the service road after crossing Old Topanga Canyon Road, take the SECOND right. (If the trail suddenly develops an iron hand-railing, you have turned right too soon.)</p>

<p>Those wishing a shorter hike can turn around whenever they wish and retrace their steps back to the Dead Horse Trailhead.</p>

<p>Post hike refreshments will be served at the Dead Horse parking lot.</p>
