<p>Hike #1296<br>
 Towlsley/Wiley Canyons<br>
 October 19, 2016</p>

<p>Ralph Shoukry, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
 RT = 6.2 miles; Elevation Gain = 1230 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to the Trailhead: Go north out of the San Fernando Valley on the I-5. Exit at Calgrove. Turn west under the freeway and turn left to proceed to the park entrance about 1/2 mile on the right. Look for sign "Ed Davis Park”. Free in parking area at entrance to park. Parking above this area will cost $5.00 (city property). Note: Toilets available only in Ed Davis Park at the picnic area. There are no toilets at the free parking lot.</p>

<p>The Basic Hike: We will depart from the free parking lot by way of the Towsley Canyon Road to the Towsley View Loop Trail, then Wiley Canyon and return to the Ed Davis Park picnic area via Canyon View Loop Trail or Towsley Canyon Road.</p>

<p>For those desiring a longer hike, after descending through a series of switchbacks (Look for trail marker # 12) explore the southern end of Towsley Canyon toward the base of Oat Mountain. Be sure to turn back no later than 12:00 PM.</p>

<p>For those desiring a shorter hike, take the Canyon View Loop Trail only. Approximately 2 Miles. Elevation gain approximately 400 feet. About midway there is a side trail to a viewpoint which will add 3/4 mile and about 400 feet elevation. The side trail is steep in areas. Footing is not good the further up you go. A good stopping point with a view is at the flat area with a big boulder.</p>

<p>You can go up Wiley Canyon to the viewpoint & return either by Towsley Canyon or the longer Canyon View Loop Trail. </p>

<p>We will have refreshments at the Ed Davis picnic area near the ranger station and fire department.</p>
