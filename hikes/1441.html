<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> Take the 405 freeway to Sunset Blvd. exit, proceed west on Sunset Blvd. about 3.2 miles to Mandeville Canyon Road.&nbsp; Turn right at the traffic light and go to the first stop sign, then left onto Westridge Road.&nbsp; Proceed to the end of Westridge Road which is the trailhead for the Mandeville Fire Road.&nbsp; There is limited parking in the trailhead parking lot (space for 10 cars).&nbsp; This hiking trail is popular with local dog owners, so the trailhead parking gets full early.&nbsp; There is plenty of overflow parking on Westridge Road north of Cordelia Road.&nbsp; Also, take care parking at the trailhead&nbsp;as the dirt lot is heavily rutted and low clearance cars can easily bottom out.&nbsp; There are no restrooms or picnic tables at the trailhead, so please bring chairs.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Hike - Fire Road - Red Trail:&nbsp;</strong> Take the Mandeville Fire Road at the left of the parking area which leads to a Nike Missile Radar Site that is on the Mulholland Fire Road.&nbsp; The Mandeville Fire Road is partially in the sun and partially in the shade.&nbsp; Tables and restrooms are available at the Nike site so this is a good place for lunch.&nbsp; Make sure you climb to the top of the observation tower for 360 degree views of the SF Valley, downtown, westside and the ocean.&nbsp; Return by the same fire road&nbsp;or alternate hike #1.</p>
<p><strong>Alternate Hike #1 - Ridge Trail - Blue Trail:&nbsp;</strong> There is a ridge trail that parallels the fire road to the right (east) for almost the entire length of the fire road.&nbsp; Access this trail from the right of the parking area.&nbsp; One can switch from fire road to ridge trail and vice versa at several location along its length.&nbsp; This ridge trail is approximately the same distance to the Nike site as the fire road but has many more ups and downs for more elevation change.&nbsp; An option would be to take the fire road up and the ridge trail on the return trip.&nbsp; The ridge trail affords much better views of the LA basin but is in full sun.</p>

<p><strong>Alternate Hike #2 - Ravine Trail - Yellow Trail:&nbsp; </strong>Whether taking the fire road or ridge trail, after 0.4 mile, look for a trail on the right heading down into a ravine.&nbsp; This is identified on the map in yellow as the <a href="../images/1394_description/Ravine_Trail.jpg">Ravine Trail</a>, however it is not signed.&nbsp; Crossing the ravine and regaining the opposite ridge at about 1 mile from the trailhead there is a junction with a road turning sharply to the right that goes down into Mandeville Canyon - stay to your left on the trail eventually regaining the fire road in another 1.5 miles (may require some bushwhacking).</p>
<p><strong>Alternate #3 - Mandeville Canyon Loop - Purple Trail:&nbsp;</strong> This option is an additional 4.25 mile loop to the basic hike.&nbsp; From the Nike site, head down to Mullholland Drive, turn right and go to the end of the dirt road (0.8 mile).&nbsp;&nbsp;At the parking lot, turn right onto the Canyonback Trail.&nbsp; After 1.0 mile look for a <a href="../images/1394_description/Hollyhock_Duck.jpg">small duck</a> and turn a sharp right, go though a metal gate onto the Hollyhock Fire Road.&nbsp; After 0.7 mile downhill, turn right onto Mandeville Canyon Road.&nbsp; After 0.25 mile, turn&nbsp;left onto Garden Land Road.&nbsp; After 100 yards, turn left onto Water and Power Pole Road.&nbsp; After 1.4 mile uphill, turn left onto the Mandeville Fire Road and return to the trailhead by the fire road (Basic Hike) or the ridge trail (Alternate hike #1).&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Alternate Hike #4 - Sullivan Canyon - Green Trail:&nbsp;</strong> Take the missile site access road down to Mulholland, and continue west on Mulholland until reaching the west ridge of Sullivan Canyon.&nbsp; Descend into the canyon and take it south down canyon 5.6 mi. to the Queensferry Road trailhead (look for a large house up on the hill to your left with large statues of animals on the hillside).&nbsp; Continue south on Queensferry Road until it intersects with Westridge Road, turn left, and return to the trailhead.</p>
