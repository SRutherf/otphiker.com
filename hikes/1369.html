<strong><br>
Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Monrovia Canyon Park is located at 1200 N.  Canyon Blvd. in the city of Monrovia.&nbsp; From the 210 freeway going either  direction take the Myrtle Ave. exit and head north through Old Town  Monrovia.&nbsp; In about a mile beyond Old Town, turn right onto Foothill  Blvd.&nbsp; Travel four blocks then turn left onto N. Canyon Blvd.&nbsp; Follow  signs to Monrovia Canyon Park.&nbsp; We will meet at the lower parking lot next  to the Ranger Station.&nbsp; There is a $5 parking fee per car. Restrooms  are available.&nbsp; If full there are  middle and upper parking lots up the road.&nbsp;  To avoid the charge street parking is ample on Canyon Ave. or Ridgeside  Dr. before the large entry gate.&nbsp; Distance to walk from the gate to the Ranger  Station is &frac14; mile.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Hikes:&nbsp;</strong> There are two nice hikes in the park.&nbsp; Those desiring  a short hike should hike to the waterfall up Monrovia Canyon. Those desiring a longer walk can take  the Ben Overturff trail up Sawpit Canyon to Deer Park.&nbsp; Those desiring the grand  tour can do both.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ben Overturff Trail Description:&nbsp;</strong> From the lower lot walk up the paved road until the fork marked by the sign for the road to Trask Boy Scout Reservation.&nbsp; Turn right  on this private road (hikers are allowed but no private vehicles).&nbsp; Hike  up this steep paved road past a dam and the Boy Scout camp.&nbsp; After one  mile the pavement ends and you are on a dirt fire road.&nbsp; In another half  mile you reach the Ben Overturff trailhead on the left, marked by a sign and  two low stone pillars just before a locked gate.<br>
<br>
The trail first descends  to cross the creek, then climbs steeply up to Twin Springs where flowing water  from one of the springs has formed a natural bridge.&nbsp; You will pass two  lateral trails back to the fire road.&nbsp; Follow signs to the Deer Springs  cabin site, where Ben Overturff ran a resort and his wife Bertha served her famous  lemon pie to hungry hikers.&nbsp; There is not much left of the cabin today.<br>
<br>
You can follow the trail  a bit further to view the remains of a stone barn and mule corral, but after  that the trail peters out and you will soon find yourself bushwhacking.&nbsp;  Return the way you came back to the last trail junction and follow the sign to  the restroom located just off the fire road.&nbsp; At this point those desiring  additional mileage and elevation gain can continue up the road to White Saddle  and the maze of fire roads beyond.&nbsp; Most of us will turn right and descend  the dirt road back to the park.<br>
<br>
<strong>Trail to Waterfall Description:&nbsp;</strong> From the lower lot walk up the paved road  to the signed trailhead on the left-Bill  Cull Trail. This trail is popular and easy to  follow.&nbsp; It first climbs a small hill then follows the stream up Monrovia  Canyon and ends at the falls.&nbsp; Along the way you will pass lateral trails  to the middle and upper parking lots.&nbsp; Bear left at each of these junctions  to continue upstream to the falls.&nbsp;  Halfway up the Bill Cull trail you may opt to add&nbsp; a .6 mile side hike on the Overlook Trail to  a 1500 ft summit lookout.</p>
On the way back, you can  visit the Nature Center at the upper parking lot if you like.&nbsp; We will  meet at the middle parking lot after the hike.&nbsp;  Restrooms are available.&nbsp; Refreshments will be served on the picnic tables  near the middle parking lot.
