<center><h3><b>Echo Mountain via Cheney Trail</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 6.5 miles<br>
Elevation Change: 1400 ft.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: From the 210 Freeway in Pasadena, exit on Lincoln Avenue.  Drive north past Altadena Drive to Loma Alta Drive and turn right.  Proceed to Cheney Trail and turn left and drive about a mile to the junction at Sunset Ridge.  Turn right and park.  An alternate route would be exiting the 210 at Lake and proceed to Alta Loma and turn left to get to Cheney Trail.</p>

<p>The Hike: Walk past the gate up the fire road about 400 yards to the Sunset Ridge Trail on the left.  Take this trail almost to the canyon bottom and turn right at the only junction.  After a steady climb, at about 2.5 miles from the cars you will return to the fire road.  Walk up the road a short distance to the Echo Mountain Rail Trail on your right.  Follow this trail to the ruins of the Echo Mountain Tavern. Be sure to review all the descriptive signs and pictures at the site.  Try out the megaphone to test the echo.  You can enjoy your lunch in the ruins or on a shaded picnic tables.</p>

<p>After lunch, return via the rail trail to the fire road.  At this point you have your choice of returning to the cars on the fire road or on the trail we came in on. Refreshments will be available at the trailhead.</p>
