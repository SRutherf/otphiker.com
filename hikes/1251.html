<p>Hike #1251<br>
Mission Peak from East Canyon<br>
November 11, 2015<br>

<p>John Chady, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
Basic hike to peak and back: 9 mi. RT, max. elevation change = 1355 ft.<br>
Meldon Canyon Option: (green + yellow trace): 10.9 mi. RT, max. elevation change = 1355 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Exit at Calgrove Ave. from northbound I-5 in Valencia (just past the I-5 & I-14 interchange). Turn left under the freeway bridge and go 0.9 mi south. Exit right on the first roadway <u>past The Church of the Nazarene on your right</u>, and work your way into a parking lot that parallels the road – a choice of either parking off-pavement along road, or in a Santa Monica Mountain Conservatory parking lot guarded by a $5 Iron Ranger. There is a small park with a water fountain available, but no bathroom facilities. Such facilities may be available at businesses beyond the Calgrove off ramp.</p>

<p>The Hike: We start on the East Canyon Motorway, soon passing Rice Canyon (signed) coming in from the right. The East Canyon trail relentlessly climbs up the ridge until joining with the Weldon Canyon Motorway, a wider road coming in from our left (yellow post with “Weldon”). We continue straight ahead on Weldon Canyon Motorway going south up along the ridge reaching, eventually, the junction with Oat Canyon and Corral Sunshine Motorways.</p>

<p>Oat Canyon on the right is blocked with a locked gate. There is a sign indicating the direction to Mission Peak which is the Corral Sunshine Motorway. We continue through a number of open gates through So. Cal. Gas Co. property until reaching the last fork at the base of the peak. Here we turn right to climb the rocky path to the peak. Return is back the same way we came.</p>

<p>An alternate return path continues on the Weldon Canyon Motorway beyond the East Canyon junction. Once the freeway is in sight, take the road that turns acutely to the left. Turn right upon reaching the paved frontage road and cross the bridge over the freeway. Turn left and walk 1.6 miles back to the trailhead along the road.</p>

<p>Directions <u>departing the trailhead:</u> Exit the parking lot and head south (road is one-way at this point). Because of the I-5 & I-14 interchange, access to northbound I-5 occurs first (to Sacramento), then the Balboa bridge (right turn provides access for Valley people to the 118), then a southbound I-5 on-ramp finally becomes available (on the left) after some 2-3 miles.
