<p><strong>Introduction:&nbsp;</strong> Our hike will begin at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center.&nbsp; Located next to Point Vicente Lighthouse, this small natural history museum is an ideal whale-watching spot.&nbsp; The many exhibits highlight the Palos Verdes peninsula?s geology, flora and fauna.&nbsp; Side trips are also possible for the more adventurous.</p>

<p><strong>Trailhead Directions:</strong>&nbsp; From the 405 Freeway take Hawthorne Boulevard south, up and over The Hill to the end of Hawthorne Blvd. at Palos Verdes Drive West.&nbsp; Turn left at the traffic light, (where you will find a Starbucks for coffee).&nbsp; Turn right at the next turn off, which will be the entrance to Point Vicente Interpretive Center, and park in the parking lot.</p>

<p>If you take the 110 Freeway go south to the Pacific Coast Hwy off-ramp and head west.&nbsp; Turn left when you come to Hawthorne Blvd. and follow the directions listed above.</p>

<p>If you want to be dropped off at Hesse Park the entrance is just past Verde Ridge Road on the right as you travel south on Hawthorne Blvd.&nbsp; Note: There are restrooms available at Point Vicente and at Hesse Park, after 9:00 am.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> The hike will take us along the coastal cliffs of Palos Verdes in the city of Palos Verdes Estates.&nbsp; If the weather cooperates, the shoreline and ocean views are magnificent and we might be able to get a great view of Catalina Island and Malibu.&nbsp; We will follow a path that takes us to Palos Verdes Drive West where we will cross to the center median where there is a walking/running path.&nbsp; We continue hiking til we come to Paseo Lunada,  turn right for one block and head up the Lunada Canyon Trail that will take us  up the hill to Hesse Park. There is a   short section of the hill that is quite steep but otherwise very manageable.</p>

<p>We end the trail by turning right onto Posey  Way, left onto Kings Harbor Dr, right onto El Rodeo Rd, right down Verde Ridge  Rd, left onto Locklenna Lane, go up some stairs on the left to enter the park.  There&rsquo;s a sail canopy with tables/benches for a rest and to admire the view. A trail leads up to restrooms at the top  of the park</p>

<p><strong>Alternate Return Route:&nbsp;</strong>Go down Hawthorne, turn right onto Crest Rd (left side  of road has sidewalk) which ends to  become Calle de Suenos, continue till you come to Panorama Estates Private Rd,  look to right is Vicente Pathway (stairs down to Point Vicente School). At  bottom, turn right onto Rue de la Pierre, left onto Via Rivera, right onto  Hawthorne Blvd till you reach Palos Verdes Dr West and onto Point Vicente  Interpretive Center.</p>
