<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.&nbsp; This will avoid the inconvenience and save costs to the hike leader.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>Directions  to Trailhead:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The  trailhead is located in Angel&rsquo;s Gate Park in San Pedro.&nbsp; The  trailhead is the parking lot and the surrounding area of the Marine Exchange.  It is located in Angel&rsquo;s Gate Park in San Pedro. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1.  Make your way to Gaffey Street in San Pedro.&nbsp; This can be from the 110 freeway,  the Vincent Thomas Bridge, or PV Drive South/25th Street. <br>
    2.  Proceed South on Gaffey Street.&nbsp; The street numbers will get bigger. <br>
    3.  At 25th street, there is an &ldquo;S&rdquo; turn.&nbsp; The left lane continues on Gaffey  Street, which is what you want. The right lane goes up the hill to 25th street,  which you don&rsquo;t want. <br>
    4.  At the light at 32nd street, make a right on Barlow Saxton Road to enter Angels Gate  Park. <br>
    5.  Go up the steep hill and the road bends around to the left. <br>
    6.  You will pass a large grass field on your left that is fenced. <br>
    7.  At the end of the large grass field there is a small, horizontal, wood sign that  says &ldquo;Marine Exchange.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you start downhill, you just missed it. <br>
    8.  Make a left and go through the white swing gate onto NCO Road. <br>
    9.  Go straight until you reach the little traffic circle, take the fork to the  right, drive to the end, and see our building.&nbsp; Park anywhere. <br>
    10.  If the group is not outside, go to the door with the glass enclosure and ring  the buzzer on the right side of the door. The VTS watch will buzz you in.&nbsp; There  are bathrooms available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp; </strong>We will all gather together so that at 9:30 am  there will be a briefing on the role of the Marine Exchange in controlling and  directing traffic to/from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. When  completed, we will all start the hike.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Option: Yellow Track:&nbsp;</strong> From  the Marine Exchange we will proceed down the hill to the Korean Friendship Bell.&nbsp; From  there, you can choose where you would like to go.&nbsp; You can easily make your way  to the Point Fermin Lighthouse, or go directly toward the Cabrillo Beach.&nbsp; For  those wanting a shorter hike, you can make your way directly back up the hill  to the Marine Exchange and enter the area the way you drove in.</p>
<p><strong>SS Lane Victory Option:&nbsp; Green Track:&nbsp;</strong> For  those wanting a longer hike, there are a couple of options. You can make your  way along Pacific Avenue to 22nd street and head down to Miner  Street.&nbsp; If you follow this until the end you will come upon the Lane Victory  WWII ship.&nbsp; You can return to the Marine Exchange as above. </p>
<p><strong>USS Iowa Option:&nbsp; Red Track:</strong>&nbsp; For  those wanting an even longer hike, you can make your way as above but turn left  at Miner and proceed north until you come to the USS battleship Iowa located  just south of the Vincent Thomas Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>Refreshments:</strong>&nbsp; Larry will BBQ hot dogs for us inside the Maritime Exchange grounds.&nbsp; It is suggested that you bring chairs.&nbsp; As it is a federal facility we will not be allowed to consume alcohol, so Larry will donate his beer to next week's leader.</p>
<p><strong>Distances:</strong><br>
  Basic: 3.0 miles RT,  300 feet.<br>
  Basic plus Lane Victory Option:&nbsp; 6.5 miles RT, 380 feet.<br>
  Basic plus USS Iowa Option:: 8.1 miles RT, 330 feet.<br>
