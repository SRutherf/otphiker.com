<p><strong>Hike #1339 <br>
October 11, 2017<br>
Jones Peak via Bailey Canyon Trail</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Ron Forbess</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meet 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>

<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
Basic Hike:&nbsp; 6.1 mi. RT, max. elevation change = 2,250 ft.<br>
Mt. Wilson Trail/Jones Ridge Loop Option:&nbsp; 6.5 mi. RT, max. elevation change = 2,440 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> From the 210 Freeway take the Michillinda Blvd. off-ramp and go north on Michillinda.&nbsp; After about 1.2 miles turn right (east) at Grandview.&nbsp; Turn left (north) at the third street, Grove. Grove will dead-end at Bailey Canyon Park.&nbsp; Go through the gate and park in the parking lot.&nbsp; If the lot is full there is plenty of parking along Grove just before the park entrance. There is a restroom in the park.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Hike:&nbsp;</strong> Up and back on the Bailey Canyon Trail to Jones Peak.&nbsp; It is not an easy hike, it is steep, but the trail is in good condition.</p>

<p><strong>Mt. Wilson Trail Loop Option:</strong>&nbsp; Exit the parking lot and walk 0.75 miles east along Carter Avenue to the beginning of the Mt. Wilson Trail.&nbsp; Hike up the trail about a mile to the unmarked junction of the Jones Ridge Route Trail.&nbsp; The trail route follows the ridge all the way to the summit of Jones Peak.&nbsp; The lower part of the trail has easy switchbacks for a while, but then it is a straight up scramble about a mile and 1,735 feet elevation gain.&nbsp; Return via the Bailey Canyon Trail back down to the parking lot.</p>

<p><strong>Shorter Options:</strong><br>
1) Hike up the Bailey Canyon trail for 2.2 miles (one way) and 1,350 feet elevation gain to the Old Cabin site.&nbsp; All that is left of the cabin are some low stone walls.&nbsp; It is shady there and a short trail leads down to the stream with lots of trees.<br>
2) Hike up the Canyon View Nature Trail, which goes to the falls.&nbsp; This trail branches off the Bailey Trail after 0.45 miles with a total distance to the falls one way from the Park of about 0.75 miles and 300 feet gain.<br>
3) Another short loop that could be combined with the Falls Trail is the Live Oak Nature Trail, which begins by crossing a bridge 0.3 miles from the Park.</p>
