  Those adventurous souls can scramble down to the islands in  the river bed and bushwhack though the <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 13.08.03.jpg">vegetation</a>.&nbsp; You could however run out of dry land so be  careful.<br>
  <br>
  You&rsquo;ll see many species of river birds (<a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 10.52.40.jpg">cormorant</a>, <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 11.19.56.jpg">heron</a>, <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 12.37.49.jpg">osprey</a>, ducks, teals, geese), <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 11.27.45.jpg">homeless encampments</a>,  <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 12.34.27.jpg">gentrification</a>, <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 10.56.32-1.jpg">bioswales</a>, <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 12.54.03.jpg">cleanup crews</a>, <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 10.58.35.jpg">giant snakes</a>, <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 12.49.33.jpg">giant fish</a>, <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 12.46.51.jpg">frogs</a>, <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 12.36.59.jpg">exercise equipment</a> and <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 12.52.10.jpg">political graffiti</a>.<br>
  <br>
  The trail is predominantly a bike path (bring comfortable  walking shoes).&nbsp; The walking lanes on  either side are sometimes very narrow, permitting only single line  walkers.&nbsp; There are many cyclists, often  going at high speeds in the center lanes.&nbsp;  Always try to walk on the left facing oncoming cyclists. NEVER CROSS OVER FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER  WITHOUT FIRST LOOKING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Supplemental River  Information:&nbsp;</strong> The headwaters of the Los Angeles River are the Bell Canyon  and Arroyo Calabasas creeks. The river starts at their junction in Canoga Park. &nbsp; The river is fed by drainage from the mountains surrounding the San Fernando  Valley, urban runoff, output of the Tillman Sewage Treatment plant, and natural  springs.&nbsp; The river runs 51 miles, exiting to the ocean in Long Beach.&nbsp; It was  finally contained in concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers after the floods  of 1938.<br>
  <br>
  The river is supported by the Friends of the LA River, a  group started by Lewis MacAdams.&nbsp; We will pass their <a href="../images/1378_description/2018-09-07 12.35.11.jpg">facility</a> on the hike.<br>
