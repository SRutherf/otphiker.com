<strong>Hike Options:<br>
</strong><br>
  <strong>1. Santa  Anita Ridge (Main Hike): </strong>This hike will start at Chantry  Flats and, instead of going down into the canyon, we will hike up the road past  the picnic area in the direction of the Helipad to the top of the Santa Anita  Ridge. The road services  a police radio antenna farm for the communities below. Bring plenty of water.&nbsp; 1250 ft gain and 7 miles RT.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2. Winter Creek Trail:</strong> The rabbits and others with extra energy may continue up  the ridge along an unmaintained trail to the Winter Creek Trail and follow it  to Chantry Flat, for approximately 2000 ft total gain and 9 miles.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
  <strong>3. Hermit  Falls:</strong> Take the paved road down into the canyon and at 0.3 miles take a dirt  trail to the right to the very pretty falls, about 700 ft. drop and 3 miles RT.  Try to refrain from diving into the pool above the falls as several people have  lost their lives doing that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>4.  Sturtevant Falls:</strong> Take the paved road down into the canyon to the bottom past  the Hogees trail then up the canyon to the falls. About 350 ft drop followed by  350 ft rise, then return, about 3.5 miles RT. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>5. Hogees  Camp Loop:</strong> Take the paved road down into the canyon 0.6 miles to the Hogee  trail, up the trail 1.8 miles to Hogee Camp, join the Winter Creek trail just  above Hogee Camp and turn left.&nbsp; About 0.2 miles later take the left fork which  returns to Chantry Flat (about 2.2 miles on trail, then 0.4 miles on the paved  road).&nbsp; Profile: down 300 ft, up 1000 ft, down 700 ft, about 5 miles total.
<p><strong>6. Spruce Grove Trail Camp Loop:</strong> Only for the  truly ambitious.&nbsp; Down into the canyon past Strutevant Falls, up to the Spruce  Grove Trail Camp, on to the Zion trail (climb Mt Zion if you like) then  continue on the loop back to Chantry Flats.&nbsp; Previously led by Larry Savell, <a href="621.pdf">hike #621</a> on  17 July 2002.</p>
