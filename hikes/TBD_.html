  <h3><b>Charlton Flats to Vetter Lookout, Mt. Mooney and Devil’s Peak</b></h3></center></p>

<p><b>Summary:</b> From a single trailhead, this description describes three hikes to the Vetter Mountain Lookout, and hikes on the Wolf Creek Interpretive trail and the Mt. Mooney-Devil Peak Loop using combinations of roads, the Silver Moccasin trail, and the Vetter Mountain trail.</p>

<p><b>Directions to the Trailhead:</b> Drive up Angeles Crest Highway to mileage paddle 47.54, then turn left on the Charlton Flats Road (3N16). After about 200 yards take the right downhill branch one half mile to a small parking area before the gate next to the tables and restrooms.</p>

<p><b>1. Vetter Mountain Hikes:</b> Three different approaches are described. One way distances are given since it is likely that hikers will go up one way and return another. In all cases, the elevation gain is about 650 ft. (For trail/road <i>color</i> designations click on the Google Earth Photo link below).</p>

<p><b>a. Vetter Mountain Trail:</b><i> (orange)</i> Look for the combined Silver Moccasin and Vetter Mountain trail <i>(green)</i> starting on the left about 100 yards down the road from the restroom just before the gate. After about 0.1 mile, the Silver Moccasin trail <i>(green)</i> leaves the pathway by making an abrupt left turn departing the Vetter Mountain trail <i>(orange)</i>. Continue ahead on the Vetter Mountain trail eventually joining the dirt access road near the summit. The trail is overgrown with lots of Poodle-dog bushes, downed trees and brush. It is still passable however. It crosses paved roads twice before reaching the summit, at each of these roads great care must be taken to find the trail on the other side of the road. One way distance is 1.5 miles.</p>

<p><b>b. Charlton Flats Road (3N16)/Silver Moccasin trail/Vetter Mountain Road:</b> From the trailhead, head north past the gate <i>(yellow)</i> about 300 yards to a U-Turn in the road. Stay on the road by making the turn <i>(blue)</i> and continue for about 1.1 cum miles. (FYI: At about .7 cum mile, the Vetter Mountain trail crosses the road). At the 1.1 mile point, turn left and go through an old picnic site, then after another 0.1 mile the path crosses the Silver Moccasin trail <i>(green)</i>. Take this trail by turning right. The Silver Moccasin trail eventually crosses one road and dead ends on the Vetter Mountain Road <i>(green)</i>. Turn right on this road and take it to the top. One way distance is 2.9 miles.</p>

<p><b>c. Silver Moccasin trail/Vetter Mountain Road:</b> Follow the instructions for route 1 above except stay on the Silver Moccasin trail <i>(green)</i> by turning left when it abruptly leaves the Vetter Mountain trail <i>(orange)</i>. The trail eventually crosses one road, dead-ending on a second road: the Vetter Mountain Road <i>(green)</i>. Turn right on this road and take it to the top. One way distance is 2.2 miles.</p>

<p><b>2. Wolf Creek Interpretive Trail</b> (Not shown on the Google Earth photo): The access trail begins on the right, just beyond the gate at the trailhead. 0.5 miles RT, 10 ft. elevation change.</p>

<p><b>3. Mt. Mooney-Devil Peak Loop via Little Pines Campground:</b> From the trailhead, proceed north on the Silver Moccasin trail <i>(yellow)</i> to Little Pines Campground located about 2.3 miles from the trailhead. Make your way out to Hwy. 2 via the campground access road, then continue south on Hwy. 2 until the dirt Mt. Mooney Truck Trail road comes in from the left <i>(yellow)</i>. Turn left and proceed on the Truck Trail <i>(yellow)</i> southerly until a 4-way intersection is reached.</p> 

The roadway to the left <i>(green)</i> goes to Mt. Mooney, the right <i>(green)</i>to the Stoney Ridge Observatory and then on to Devil’s Peak. Continuing straight ahead <i>(green)</i> will take you back to Hwy. 2 where a short jog on the road to the left will bring you to the entrance of Charlton Flats <i>(green)</i>. 6.0 miles RT. Note that the trail near the top of Devil’s Peak is very heavily overgrown.</p>
