<center><h3><b>Backbone East, Piuma Road to Saddle Peak</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 10 miles RT<br> 
Elevation gain: 2000 ft.</p>
 
<p>Directions to Trailhead: From PCH go north on Malibu Canyon Road.  From the 101 go south on Las Virgenes Road. Turn east at Piuma Road at the traffic light and proceed east on Piuma Road.  About 1/2 mile past Cold Canyon Road, and opposite mile paddle 1.07, park in leveled area of a future home site. The trailhead is a very short walk from here.</p>

The Hike: The first part of the hike is a rather steep 2 mile climb with many switchbacks. Frequent breath and water breaks will be automatic because of the dramatic views of canyon and mountains accorded at every turn. Continue on the Backbone Trail until the junction to Stunt Road and to Saddle Peak is reached. Turn right and continue to the top of Saddle Peak. Your persistence and fortitude will be rewarded beyond your wildest imaginations. Return the way you came.</p>

<p>Those preferring a shorter hike are encouraged to continue on the Backbone Trail to Stunt Road. Rest and relax, eat your lunch, enjoy the spectacular views and the birds. Smell the flowers too, then return the way you came.</p>
 
<p>Refreshments will be served at the parking lot on the west side of Las Virgenes Canyon Road below the Malibu Creek bridge/Piuma Canyon Road. We will move the cars to this place after the hike.</p>
