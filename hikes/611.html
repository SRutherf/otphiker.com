<center><h3><b>Sullivan Canyon from Queensferry Road - Shuttle</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 9 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1600 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: In Brentwood go 2.3 miles west of the San Diego Freeway on Sunset Blvd.  Turn north onto Mandeville Canyon Road for 0.3 mile to Westridge Road.  Turn left and follow the twists and turns for 1.1 miles turning left at Bayliss, then 0.3 mile to Queensferry Road, turn left.  Drivers will leave hikers at Queensferry Road.  Drivers will then drive to the end of Westridge Road and park their cars.  We will have our refreshments there. Two cars will bring drivers back to their cars at the trailhead.</p>

<p>The Hike: Pick your way along the bottom of the canyon as it very gently ascends to the north.  The floor of the canyon is shaded with Sycamore trees, Coast Live Oaks, Walnuts, and other moisture-loving trees.  Watch out for POISON OAK.</p>

<p>Farther up the canyon a tall Eucalyptus tree on the left makes a good landmark.  This point is about 3 miles from the trailhead and can be used as a turnaround point for a shorter hike, as the trail becomes steeper from here on.  Climbing in earnest, you swing around some sharp turns and then hook up with the West-Ridge fire road at 4.3 miles.  Continue north to unpaved Mulholland Drive.  Follow Mulholland east along the Santa Monica Mountains divide toward the Nike missile base atop of San Vicente Mountain (5.5 miles).</p>

<p>From the missile site, head south along the fire road.  It curves around several bumps on the ridge between Mandeville and Sullivan canyons, climbing on occasions, but mostly descending.  At 9.0 miles you reach the dead end of Westridge Road.</p>
