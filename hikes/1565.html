<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;From  the 210 Freeway drive north on Angeles Crest Hwy (Hwy 2) for 17.4 miles to the  Red Box parking area on the right (south) side of the road. From Red Box take  Mount Wilson Road 2.3 miles to unsigned Eaton Saddle and park there.</p>
<p><strong>Mount Lowe Summit:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;From Eaton Saddle head up the fire road to the unsigned  Markham Saddle and the intersection with the Mt. Lowe East Trail. Blue on hike map below. May be hiked clockwise or  counterclockwise (recommended). Then take the Mount Lowe East Trail and  make a gentle climb to East-West Trail Junction and make a right hand  &quot;U&quot; turn and continue climbing on the West Trail till you reach the  top of Mount Lowe<strong><em>.&nbsp; If you don't want to go any further, you may return the way you came.<br>
</em></strong><br>
  <strong><em>Mt. Lowe Summit Egress</em></strong>: From the top of Mount Lowe descend a little bit till  you come to a &quot;Y&quot; and take the left hand branch and continue  descending on the West Trail.&nbsp; This descent is steep.&nbsp; Eventually you  reach the fire road and make a left turn.&nbsp; As you go down the gently  descending fire road you will notice there are two trails marked Mount Lowe  East Trail.&nbsp; It branches into two trails near the bottom, so when you go  back take the one you come across first.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>Inspiration Point Leg</em></strong>: Shortly thereafter you come to a &quot;Y&quot; of  the fire road.&nbsp; Take the left branch.&nbsp; After a short gentle climb you  reach the Inspiration Point where there is a shelter and a great lunch  spot.&nbsp; If you don't want to go any further take the East Trail back which  is a pretty steep uphill climb (about 1000 ft.).&nbsp; When you reach East-West  Trail junction be sure to stay on the East Trail (right hand side branch going  down).<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  <strong><em>Fire Road Option to Return</em></strong>: <strong><em>If you do not like the steep climb, take the road back all the way to  the trailhead. </em></strong>Light Blue on the map below. Retrace your steps  back to the intersection of the West Trail and continue on the fire road to the  noted intersection with the Tom Sloane route then turn right and continue back  to the trailhead.<strong></strong><br>
  <br>
<strong>Hike Options:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong>: <strong><em>Tom Sloane Saddle</em></strong>. Red on hike map  below. From Markham Saddle continue hiking (generally to the west) on the fire  road to a place where the trail makes a sharp 180 degree turn to the left  (south and then toward the east &ndash; Blue trail on hike map). Here you will find  the intersection with the Tom Sloan Saddle trail leading to Brown Mountain.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Option 2:</strong> <strong><em>Brown Mountain Summit</em></strong> &ndash; Red on the hike  map below. From Tom Sloane Saddle continue west on the use trail (toward the  left heading up) that leads to Brown Mountain summit. <strong>Be advised that this is a faint  use trail that is challenging with many false summits and additional elevation gains  and losses. At the summit of Brown Mountain take a break and enjoy the views  and return on the same trail/fire road to Eaton Saddle. Refer to video link  below.</strong><br>
  <br>
<strong>Bonus Peak &ndash; <em>San  Gabriel Peak</em></strong> &ndash; Yellow on the hike  map below. For those that want a shorter hike or want to bag an additional  peak. The San Gabriel Peak trail is located near the trailhead on the right  (north). Partially noted on the hike map in yellow. </p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: All options can be mixed and matched to create  shorter or longer/easier or harder hikes.</em></p>
