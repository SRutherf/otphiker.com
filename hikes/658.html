<center><h3><b>Hidden Springs to Fall Creek</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 7.3 miles RT<br>
Elevation: 1200 ft.</p>

<p>Summary: This hike explores the narrows of Big Tujunga Canyon. Starting from Hidden Springs Picnic area, we walk down some 1000 ft. into the canyon reaching the Fall Creek Campground area for lunch. At this point we have a choice, to return to Hidden Springs the way we came by climbing all of the elevation we have lost, or taking the "escape route" which climbs steeply out of the canyon to Big Tujunga Road. For this option, a shuttle must be prearranged to drive back to Hidden Springs, or else depend on a good soul (pun not intended) to return you to the trailhead. Otherwise it will be a long walk back on Angeles Crest Highway.</p>

<p>Directions to the Trailhead:  Drive up the Angeles Crest Highway 9.5 miles to Clear Creek Junction, then left on the Angeles Forest Highway toward Palmdale.  Just after passing through the tunnel, park on the left side in the parking lot at Hidden Springs Picnic Area which is at mileage paddle 17.96 about 6.5 miles from Clear Creek Junction.</p>


<p>After walking along the west side of Angeles Forest Highway for 300 yards north we get to the start of the trail. It goes up along a small canyon (North Fork Mill Creek) a short distance and then veers left along a brushy hillside.  After gaining about 500 feet, the trail levels, contours for another mile, and then begins dropping steadily 1000 feet into Big Tujunga Canyon.  While descending, we enjoy the view up the V-shaped gash of Big Tujunga’s Narrows to the east.  At 3.5 miles, the trail ends at a junction of dirt roads.  The left branch leads 200 yards east to Fall Creek Trail Camp.  From the camp we must hike about half a mile further, dropping 200 feet to Mill Creek where we can break for lunch and rest our weary feet.</p>
