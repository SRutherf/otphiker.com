<p>Hike #1233<br>
July 8, 2015<br>
Nicholas Flat from Leo Carrillo State Beach</p>

<p>Roland Bassett, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
RT = 6.6 mi.<br>
Elevation gain = 1700 ft.</p>
 
<p>Directions to Trailhead: The trailhead is at Leo Carrillo State Beach which is about 10 miles west of Malibu Canyon Road on the PCH.  There is a charge for parking and there are restrooms nearby.</p>

<p>The Hike: The Nicholas Flat trail takes us up a steep path gaining the 1700 ft. in the first 2.4 miles. Once achieving the 1700 ft., there is a nice up and down stroll the rest of the way with the possible exception of a short distance of a tunnel like passage through heavy growth.  The trail is well defined with some off-shoots for any peak baggers.  Once you reach a rutted road-like trail you will come to a fork, take the <b>right tine</b> to go to the lunch spot which is a rocky outcropping along side the lake with an excellent view of the Pacific Ocean. Return the way you came.</p>
