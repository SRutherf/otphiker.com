<p>Distance: 7 mi. RT<br>

<p>Directions to the Trailhead: Go west on the 118 freeway.  Exit at Topanga Canyon and turn left (south). Turn right on Devonshire (1.4 miles).  Devonshire will dead end at Chatsworth Park South (.4 miles).  Go through the gates to the west end of the parking lot.  There are restrooms there.</p>

We did this hike about 3 years ago with Dave Lillback as the leader. Better description coming - as soon as I get my folder back from Ralph.
