<p><strong>Summary:&nbsp; </strong>The hike is along  the nice but thinly forested high country of the Angeles National Forest.&nbsp; The  basic hike is an out and back to the ridge that forms the summit of Mt.  Waterman at 8038 feet.&nbsp; A bit longer version allows completing a loop by  returning down the dirt road that is part of the Mt. Waterman ski area.<br>
  <br>
Waterman is an  elongated, broad-summited mountain with three high points.&nbsp; The highest point lies near the southwestern  edge of the summit plateau.&nbsp; From here,  you are rewarded with fine views of the western San Gabriels and the depths of  Devils Canyon.<br>
<br>
<strong>History:</strong>&nbsp; In 1889 Bob Waterman, his  wife Liz and Commodore Ferry Switzer took a trip across the San Gabriels.&nbsp; Enroute they scrambled up the highest  mountain in the vicinity to get their bearings, built a cairn and left a  register.&nbsp; They named the mountain in  honor of Liz, Lady Waterman Mountain.&nbsp; When the USGS mapped the mountain, they left  off the &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; part.&nbsp; Bob Waterman tried  for many years to get back the full name without success.<br>

<strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> Leave the 210 freeway at Highway 2, the Angeles Crest Highway.&nbsp; Continue up the Angeles Crest Highway for 34 miles to the Buckhorn Day Use Area parking area on the left. This is not to be confused with Buckhorn Campground.&nbsp; If you reach  the campground entrance, turn around and backtrack a few hundred yards to the  day use area.&nbsp; There are no rest rooms at the trailhead, but there are restrooms at  Buckhorn Day Use Area.&nbsp; Print the maps below for your use.&nbsp; Use your Golden Age Passport for  parking.<br>
<br>
<strong>Hike:&nbsp;</strong>The hike begins by crossing the highway and proceeding up a gated fire  road.&nbsp; In a quarter mile you reach a signed junction with the Waterman  trail.&nbsp; It is recommended to turn left here and hike the loop in a clockwise  direction. Continue up the trail and at a little less  than 2 miles there will be a first look down at the Los Angeles basin.&nbsp; A bit  further a junction with the trail that leads to Twin Peaks will be reached. &nbsp; Only real tigers should choose to go toward Twin Peaks. &nbsp;Turn right to continue up to Waterman.&nbsp; As the ridge like summit of Mt. Waterman is  approached there are trail choices to your left, and the higher choices will  get you to the boulder outcroppings that form the summit.&nbsp; Returning as you came  will result in a 6-mile hike with a gain of 1250 feet.<br>
  <br>
Those  wishing to complete the 7.5 mile loop should continue west along the crest and  drop down a bit to find the ski areas upper dirt road.&nbsp; Follow the dirt road  down through the ski area to the crossing of the trail near the trailhead.</p>
BYO refreshments at the Buckhorn Day Use  Area, which is a few hundred feet past the parking area.
