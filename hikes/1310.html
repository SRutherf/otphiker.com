<p>Hike #1310<br>
Garapito Trail to Hub Junction<br>
March 8, 2017
<p>Vicky Ritter, Hike Leader

<p>GPS Data:
RT = 7.3 mi RT<br>
Max Elevation Gain = 800 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>&nbsp; Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park is at 3600 Reseda Blvd. Tarzana, CA 91365. &nbsp; From the 101, get off at Reseda Blvd. and go south for 3.2 mi.  You'll pass Ventura Blvd., Braemar Country Club, and some gated-community houses. &nbsp; Reseda Blvd. dead-ends at the park, so it's hard to get lost. &nbsp; Parking is curbside and costs $3.00 close to the turnaround, but you can park further down the street for free.&nbsp; There are two Andy Gumps at the turn around and potable water where we'll have refreshments.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:</strong>&nbsp; We will hike up the dirt road extension of Reseda Blvd. from Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park.&nbsp; Upon reaching Mulholland, turn right and walk along Mulholland Dr. a few hundred feet to the entrance of Fire Road 30. &nbsp; There is a locked gate across the road, but a big "30" is painted on the right gate post so you'll know the start of Fire Road 30.</p>

<p>Walk 0.5 mile along Fire Road 30 and the sign "Garapito Canyon Trail 2.5 mi." will be on the right. &nbsp; Fire Road 30 starts out descending, and then starts ascending. &nbsp; The sign is at this change of elevation, so look for the sign at this point.  It is not all that big (a biker had to point it out).</p>

<p>Garapito is a very pleasant trail, much like the Musch Trail out of Trippet Ranch Park. &nbsp; It is shaded, and the overgrowth has been recently cut back. &nbsp; The trail ends at a "T" with another fire road.  Go left at this "T" for 0.8 mi. to Hub Junction and Fire Road 30.&nbsp; This is a good place to eat lunch. After lunch, turn left at the Hub on Fire Road 30 to return to the trailhead.</p>

<p>For those wanting a longer hike, turn right at the "T" and go the Eagle Peak for lunch (adds 0.5 mile total, over and back).&nbsp; After lunch, retrace your steps and continue past the "T" to the Hub, and Fire Road 30, turn left and return to the trailhead.</p>

<p>Refreshments served at the Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park trailhead.</p>
