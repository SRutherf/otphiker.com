<p>Distance: unknown<br>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take the Zoo Drive exit off Interstate 5.  Park at the Autry Museum.</p>

<p>The Hike: We start out on the footpath along Crystal Springs Drive.  At the ranger station, turn right onto Griffith Park Drive and climb the steep fire road (Old Zoo Trail), edging high and to the north as it forks. Beneath Amir's Garden, the road becomes Mineral Wells Trail.  Cross Griffith Park Drive just north of the recycling center and trudge up Skyline Trail, turning south at the ridge.  At the bottom of the hill, use the equestrian tunnels to pass under the street and then loop back to the Autry Museum.
