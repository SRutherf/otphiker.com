<center><h3><b>Mount McKinley/Iron Mountain from Lightning Point CG</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance to Mt. McKinley: 6 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain: -800 ft. (We climb to get back to the trailhead)</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead:  From the 210, drive north 10.5 miles to Angeles Forest Hwy. Turn left on Angeles Forest Hwy. for 14 miles to mile paddle 10.37 which is Mill Creek Summit.  Turn left onto the road that goes toward Messinger Flat and proceed another 9 miles to a fork in the road. Take the left fork (<u>not</u> the right fork to Messinger Flat) .5 mile to another fork. Take the right fork (<u>not</u> the left fork into Lightning Point Campground) and proceed 3 miles to a locked gate.  Park in the wide area on either side of the road.</p>

<p>The Hike: The hike will be to Mount McKinley.  No, not Denali, but our own little Mount McKinley right here in the San Gabriel Mountains.  However, bragging rights will still be earned by those who reach the peak.</p>

<p>The hike follows Mendenhall Ridge with outlooks to both the north and south.  The hike will be mainly on a fire road until we reach the Yerba Buena trail at about 4.5 miles. We take this trail to McKinley saddle. The 1/4 mile from the saddle to the peak is a bit of a scramble.</p>

<p>Along the way we pass by Iron Mountain (5360 ft.) which can be reached by a short side trip.</b>
