<p><strong>Hike: </strong> 2.6 miles and 1277 ft rise (one way)
<p><strong>Directions to trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> Exit the 210 freeway in Altadena at Lake Ave. and proceed  north for 1.5 miles until Lake ends at Loma Alta Drive - park on the street. </p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp; </strong>The hike begins by entering the gate at the Cobb Estate and  preceding east about 1/2 mile until reaching the San Merrill/Echo Mountain/Lowe  RR trail heading north.&nbsp; Be careful not to turn to the north too quickly but  wait until you descend into a small canyon, where the trail will be plainly  marked.&nbsp; The trail is a constant up for another 2 miles, affording lovely views  to the south (weather permitting).&nbsp; At the end of this trail (Echo Mountain),  you can take a right turn with a short walk to the old hotel site, lunch, and  return by the same route - total about 5 miles. </p>
<p>For the more ambitious, it is recommended that you make a  left turn (versus a right turn to the hotel) and proceed up the Echo Mountain  Trail/old RR grade to see the remains of the RR that went to the hotel.&nbsp; When  you reach the road, turn around and return the way you came and continue on to  the old hotel for lunch and then back to your car - total about 8.5 miles. </p>
<p>Refreshments will be served at Farnsworth Park, 568 E. Mount  Curve Ave, Altadena, CA 91001, about 0.2 miles from the hike trailhead.</p>
