<center><h3><b>La Ballona State Park - La Ballona Wetlands</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 12 miles RT (to the ocean)<br>
Elevation gain: 100 ft.<p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: From the corner of Duquesne & Jefferson Blvd. in Culver City, continue on Duquesne up the hill for 0.2 mile. Turn left into the parking lot for the wooden ramp for the handicapped. Restrooms: one toilet is hidden in the trees just after the ramp begins and behind the climbing poles. Another is in the playground on the right side of Duquesne.</p>

<p>The Hike: Walk on the sidewalk the 0.2 mile to Jefferson Blvd., cross it and enter the bike path in the direction of the ocean.</p>

<p>POINT OF INTEREST #1: The vibrant mosaic at the entrance to the bike path is made of tiles. The County of Los Angeles funded this Millennium 2000 project.  Students from Culver Park High school, an alternative school for students whose behavior does not allow them in a regular school, designed and made these tiles, carefully numbering them on the back.  They were assembled under the direction of Mim Shapiro of the Ballona Creek Renaissance Organization.</p>

<p>Continue hiking 1 mile to Overland Avenue. Cross Overland Ave. carefully.  The library contiguous to the bike path can be a restroom stop.  It is the last public facility until the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>POINTS OF INTEREST #2: Deviate a few steps to the lovely Japanese Meditation Park, which contains a water wheel and a tori.  It is in front of the library.  This was a gift from Culver City's sister city of Kaizuka City in Japan in March 1972.</p>

<p>POINT OF INTEREST #3: Walk on the bridge crossing Overland.  Look across the creek at the scenic mural made for the millennium by Culver Middle School students. Unfortunately, it has been marred by graffiti.</p>

<p>At Ocean Drive directly across the bridge, enter the creek through an open gate and continue along the graveled top past two footbridges to Culver High.  Walk under the bridges and every other bridge until coming to the ocean.  There are bridges across Sepulveda and Centinela and several more.  Locked gates prevent street access.  Checkout the shore birds resting along the creek bed. Stop at the UCLA sculling facility.</p>

<p>Return the way you came.</p>
