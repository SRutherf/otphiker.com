<p><strong>Directions:</strong> Brand Park is  located at 1601 W Mountain St. in Glendale.&nbsp; From Interstate 5 take Western  Ave. north to Mountain St. and turn right.&nbsp; Enter the park on the  left.&nbsp; We will meet in the lower parking lot just above the baseball field  next to a restroom.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> The signed  Seven Trees Trail starts behind the former Brand Mansion now converted into a  library.&nbsp; It climbs up to a flat rest area with a bench and the seven  trees about a mile from the start.&nbsp; The final climb is rather steep and  sometimes slippery so watch your step.&nbsp; If you are not comfortable with  steep and slippery you can still reach Seven Trees by doing the trail in  reverse with a much gentler grade.&nbsp; From here you have two choices.</p>
<p><strong>Long Loop (7.25 miles, red on  map):&nbsp;</strong> Turn right and climb straight up the ridge to the Verdugo  Motorway.&nbsp; This route has no maintained trail and is only for the toughest  among us.&nbsp; Turn left on the Verdugo Motorway, passing Tongva Peak along  the way, to a junction with the Brand Motorway.&nbsp; Turn left and take this  road back down to the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Short Loop (2.1 miles, green  on map):&nbsp;</strong> From Seven Trees take the road down to where it meets the Brand  Motorway.&nbsp; If you want more mileage take the Brand Motorway up to the  crest or as far as you want to go, returning the same way back to the parking  lot.</p>
<p>Whichever way you go everyone  should take a short side trip to visit the Brand Family Cemetary.&nbsp; There  is a small sign pointing the way to a few stone steps climbing up to the final  resting place of the Brand family including the family dogs.&nbsp; Leslie Brand  himself is buried under a very large impressive pyramid.</p>
<p>After the hike bring a chair  or a blanket and we will picnic on the grass of the Japanese Tea Garden located  across from the parking lot.</p>
