<p><strong>West Valley Hike<br>
  Browns Canyon<br>
December 2, 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>Meet at 8:00 am</strong></p>
<p><b>GPS Data:</b><br>
5.2 miles RT. 935 feet elevation gain.</p>

<p><b>Directions to Trailhead:</b> &nbsp;From the 118 freeway travelling east take the De Soto Ave. exit and turn left (north) under the freeway.&nbsp; From the 118 freeway travelling west take the De Soto Ave. exit and turn right at the end of the off ramp. Turn immediately right onto Brown&rsquo;s Canyon Road.&nbsp;On your way from De Soto to the trailhead you will also  notice two signs saying &hellip; &ldquo;Bridge Closed to General Public - Open to Residents  Only.&rdquo;&nbsp; The MRCA ranger said that  we could ignore those signs, so don&rsquo;t let them deter you from continuing. Go 1.1 miles to the southern end of the Michael D. Antonovich Regional  Park. The address is 16100 Browns Canyon Road.&nbsp; Plug that in your  GPS.&nbsp; The trailhead on the left has a sign saying &ldquo;Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Zone  Parkland.&rdquo;&nbsp;There is little parking so park off the road where available.</p>
<p><b>The Hike:</b>&nbsp;Start on the trail going around the gate by the sign.&nbsp; Follow the trail in a gentle climb for 0.45 miles. &nbsp;Take the sharp right turn up a steeper slope for about 0.1 miles, then take a sharp left turn on the ridge.&nbsp; Stay on the ridgeline, avoiding a left fork into Blind Canyon at 0.75 miles and avoiding a right fork down into Browns Canyon after 1.45 miles.&nbsp; Continue along this ridgeline until 1.85 miles (total), then turn right onto a fire road (Curaco TR).&nbsp; In about another 0.2 miles (2.03 miles total), turn left onto Browns Canyon Road.&nbsp; A further 100 yards along Browns Canyon Road is a gate across the road preventing vehicle access up to the Nike Missile Site, LA-88, for anyone without a key to the locked gate.&nbsp; At 2.3 miles you will reach a fire road leading to the left. Another half mile along Browns Canyon Road would take you to the Nike Missile Site.&nbsp;Alternatively take the fire road for as far as you wish to go.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Return to the trailhead via Browns Canyon Road.</p>
