<center><h3><b>Angel's Walk - Los Angeles (Northern Loop)</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 6 miles RT on pavement<br>
Elevation gain: 50 ft.

<p>Summary: The purpose of this hike is to introduce you to a few of the sights of our civic center. Another is to induce you to try public transportation, especially the MetroRail which is fast and economical. We will meet at Union Station near the front (Alameda Street). The plan is to split into small groups, each led by a person who is familiar with the route. To keep track of each group's progress, we will have designated assembly points where we will all join together for a headcount, toilets, etc. We will communicate by cell phone, and a list of numbers will be made available.</p>

<p>Directions to trailhead: Using public transportation, assemble in front of Union Station at the appointed time. If you must drive please note that there is parking at the old Post Office Annex, about 3 blocks north of Union Station, East side of Alameda, for $ 3/day.</p>

<p>The Hike:</p>

<p>1. Puebla de Los Angeles, the birthplace of our city. Walk across Alameda, stay on right side of Los Angeles toward the Plaza. Follow right and note the Mexican Consulate and the Methodist Church. Just past the church, turn right into Olvera Street and enjoy the sights, smell and sounds of an old Mexican street scene. About midway through, note the Avila Adobe Museum on the right side, oldest adobe in city. At the exit of Olvera Street note plaque for the <i>zanja madre</i> the "Mother Ditch", the aqueduct which first brought water to the puebla.</p> 

<p>Turn left, west, at Cezar Chavez. The first Catholic Church in Los Angeles, Our Lady Queen of the Angels established in 1781, is on the north side of Cezar Chavez. Note the mosaic above the entrance. Cross over at crosswalk if you wish to visit the church and its plaza. Return to south side of Cezar Chavez, or north side of old plaza, at the same cross walk colorful native dances are often performed here on weekends or special occasions.</p>

<p>Continue counter clockwise around plaza. Note old restored Pico House and unrestored buildings dating from the late 1800's. On the corner past the Pico House is a one story red brick building, Fire House #1, the first fire station in Los Angeles from 1884. It's worth a look. We will wait here for everyone to catch up.</p>

<p>2. Turn corner and walk west from the fire station on Arcadia one block to North Main Street. Turn left, south, and walk on the east side of Main Street. City Hall is the tall obelisk-like building:  It is possible to go to the top and the observation deck - but not on this hike. On the left is the Los Angeles Mall followed by the Trifolium in the Fletcher-Bowen Square. Note mosaic over entrance to City Hall-East and then a neat little park with fountains guarded by two stone Chinese lions behind black iron gates.</p>
 <p>Note the L.A. Times building one block west on 1st St. Cross over to the west side of Main Street at 1st. Note the New Otani Hotel  which is in Little Tokyo. Continue south on Main, note St. Vibiana's, the original Catholic Cathedral damaged by the 1994 earthquake. At 3rd St. turn right and continue to South Spring Street. Cross to the south-west corner of 3rd and Spring. Walk south on Spring Street to 333 S. Spring. Walk through the arcade to a small park, Biddy Mason Park. Read the history of this black woman who walked to California in 1851 as a slave behind her master's wagon train at the "wall of memories", a series of bronze plaques that follow from right to left. We will wait here until all catch up. </p>

<p>3. Continue through the park, turn right on Broadway and walk north to the Bradbury Building at 304 South Broadway. Enter and have a look at the most photographed lobby in Los Angeles. From the Bradbury, walk north to the corner of 3rd and cross over to the west side of Broadway. Walk south to 317 S. Broadway, the Grand Central Market. Walk through the market and experience its sights and sounds. Continue through the market, cross Hill Street and you are at the foot of Angel's Flight and the 50-foot elevation gain. Climb the stairs to the top (or ride the cable car) to the Water Court at California Plaza. We will wait here for all to catch up. Toilets are also available here.</p>

<p>4. Continue through the court, and turn right, north, on Grand Avenue to Temple. Directly opposite is the Wells Fargo center. An interesting museum of the bank's history is here. Walking up to Temple Street you will note the Museum of Modern Art, the new Disney Concert Hall, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre. Cross Temple Street and you are at the new cathedral. Turn right and walk south to the entrance. The cathedral staff conducts tours, however, just inside the entrance on the left is a table with map and information sufficient so that you may tour the cathedral on your own (no longer than 15 minutes - please). The entrance to the cathedral is up the stairs to the left past the information table. Follow the map. We will wait on the plaza at the top of the right hand stairs until all catch up. Toilets are available here.</p>

<p>5. Exit the cathedral and turn right on Temple and go back to Grand Avenue. Turn right on Grand and cross over the freeway. You are now on Fort Moore Hill.  The fort was active about 1850. The strange looking building is the new Los Angeles School District high school for the arts. An obelisk type monument behind the building is a monument to those who served at Fort Moore. Go down the hill and turn right on Cesar Chavez Blvd to Broadway.We will wait here for all to catch up.</p>

<p>6. Turn left, north, on Broadway and …WELCOME to CHINATOWN.  Enter through the dragon gates. And walk a few blocks savoring the environment. Turn right, east, on Ord Street, named for the surveyor assigned by the federal government to survey the site for a city. Walk on the north side of Ord St. street to Alameda and the world famous Phillipe's Restaurant - one of the oldest continuously operated restaurants in L.A. and purported to be the "founder" of the French dip sandwich. This will be the final stop on the Angels Walk and a great place to have lunch (sorry - at your expense).</p>
<p>7. Leave Phillipe's by the front door, turn right on Alameda and return to Union Station or, turn left and return to the Post Office Annex parking lot.
