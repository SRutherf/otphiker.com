Ice House Saddle</p>

<p>Bob DeWolf, Hike Leader</p>

<p><b>GPS Data:</b><br>
 One way Trailhead to Chapman fork = 1.6 mi.<br>
 Basic Hike: Up-canyon to Icehouse Saddle: RT = 7.4 mi. & 2775 ft.<br>
 Option 1: Chapman Loop to Icehouse Saddle = RT = 9.8 mi. & 2775 ft.<br>
 Option 2: To Cedar Glen Campsite & back: = RT = 6.6 mi. & 1610 ft.<br>
 Option 3 Add-on: Saddle to Timber Mtn: = RT = 0.7 mi. & 730 ft.<br>

<p><b>Directions to trailhead:</b> Take the 210 freeway east and exit on Baseline Rd. As you exit, turn left and then right on Padua Rd (first road to the right). Follow this road north which joins Mt. Baldy Rd. Go 1.5 miles past Mt. Baldy Village to Icehouse Canyon Resort. For those who want to drive a more familiar way, exit Mountain Ave. which also joins Mt. Baldy Road. There are radar/camera enforced speed limits in Mt. Baldy Village.</p>

<p><b>The Hike:</b> The trail leads east along the floor of the canyon. The path stays close to the oak and spruce-shaded creek and passes some cabins. After 1.6 miles, the trail forks and we continue straight ahead on the shorter but somewhat steep Icehouse Canyon Trail directly up the canyon. The trail climbs up the north slope of the canyon, before dropping down again and crossing the creek. The Chapman Trail intersects with the up-canyon trail and the combined trail ascends a steep .75 mile to the top of Icehouse Saddle.</p>

<p><b>Option 1:</b> Chapman Loop: At 1.6 miles, take the Chapman Trail to Cedar Glen Campsite. Continue on the Chapman Trail to where it intersects with the Icehouse Canyon Trail and continue up to the saddle.</p>

<p><b>Option 2:</b> For those who wish a shorter hike, a hike to the Cedar Glen Campsite and back is recommended.</p>

<p><b>Option 3:</b> For those who want to hike a little further, take the Three T's Trail to Timber Mountain.</p>
