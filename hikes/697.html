<p>From I-5 northbound, exit Stadium Way/Riverside Drive and turn right. Proceed about 1 mile to Oros St. and park on street at Blake and Oros.</p> There are no bathrooms at the trailhead, nor along the trail until reaching Los Feliz Blvd., the turn-around point of the hike.</p>

<p>The Hike: Proceed east on Oros to the entrance to the LA River Greenway trail, turn left and proceed north along the river to the park at Los Feliz Blvd. Note the graffiti on the walls - some of it quite inspired. Note the ingenuity of the homeless community in providing for their shelter. Look for the stantions spaced along the top of the each side of the river bank where the fire department rigs ropes to try to save people being swept down river in the rapid currents during the winter rains. Return the way you came.
