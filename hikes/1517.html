<p><strong>Trailhead  Directions:&nbsp;</strong> For GPS purposes,  the trailhead is 3200 La Rotonda Drive, Rancho Palos Verdes.&nbsp; <br>
Drive south to the end of the 110  freeway, exit on Gaffey Street, right on 1st Street, left on Western Ave, and  right on 25th Street (which becomes Palos Verdes Drive South), then left on La  Rotonda Drive to the parking lot.&nbsp; There is a restroom at the trailhead.  </p>
<p><strong>Hikes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short</strong> - 3 miles, 200 ft elevation gain.&nbsp; Ocean Trails       Reserve trails are through the Trump National Golf Course and are somewhat       narrower than the golf cart paths.&nbsp; At point 'C' in front of the club       house the trail is one-person wide between hedges.&nbsp; At its end, walk       down to a sandy trail beside the driving range, then left on the narrow       West Bluff trail at 'D'.&nbsp; The sandy trail and black-top road beside Palos       Verdes Dr. both go to the same place - I recommend taking the road to be away       from traffic.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate</strong> - 6.1 miles, 500 ft gain.&nbsp; Cross Palos Verdes Dr. at the       golf course entrance, walk up Forrestal Drive to the Pirate Trail - 'E' on       the map.&nbsp; Although the trails aren't marked, the hike then goes on       the Mariposa, Flying Mane 'F', Canyon, and Conqueror trails.&nbsp; Ladera       Linda Park is closed, and so is soccer field access, so take Main Sail Road to get back to       Forrestal Dr.</p>
<p><strong>Long</strong> - 9.6 miles, 1150 ft gain.&nbsp; The Conqueror trail       provides entry into the Portuguese Reserve.&nbsp; The Klondike trail 'G'       leads to the Burma Road, then up to the Eagle's Nest 'H'.&nbsp; Return via       Peppertree and Barn Owl trails back to the Conqueror trail.</p>
<p>Please bring  bring a few folding chairs so we can gather in the parking area after our  hike&nbsp;for BYO refreshments.</p>
