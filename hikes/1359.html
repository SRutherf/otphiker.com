<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
Basic Hike: 7.9 mi. RT; Max. elevation gain = 1035 ft.   (Yellow trace)<br>
Encinal Add-on: 0.7 mi. RT; 75 ft. elevation loss and gain.   (Blue trace)</p>
 
<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead: &nbsp;</strong><strong>From PCH:</strong> &nbsp;Go north on Kanan Dume Road until you go through the tunnel, then park in the Newton Canyon Trailhead parking area on the left side of the road.&nbsp; <strong>From the 101:</strong> &nbsp;Take Kanan Dume Road south, and proceed through 2 tunnels. &nbsp;About 2 miles beyond the intersection with Mulholland you’ll see the Newton Canyon Trailhead parking area on the right.  If you go through the 3rd tunnel, you’ve gone too far. &nbsp; There is a restroom at the trail head.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike: </strong>&nbsp;From the trailhead the first portion of the hike goes northwest 2.5 miles on the Backbone Trail. &nbsp;The first half mile is a bit tricky, as there are several false trails. &nbsp;Stay on the most heavily used trails upslope from the creek (Zuma Creek).&nbsp; About 2 miles along the trail we pass Upper Zuma Falls which are usually dry. &nbsp;There is a poor trail over to the Falls with heavy poison oak undergrowth so it is not a recommended side trip.</p>

<p>At 2.5 miles the Backbone Trail comes out on Zuma Ridge Trail, which, despite the name, is a graded fire road.&nbsp; We travel south up this moderately steep trail 1.4 miles to the “top”. &nbsp; This is a good place for lunch, with a sweeping view of the ocean from Catalina to Santa Cruz Island.</p>

<p>Do not take the side road that leads to the Buzzard Roost Ranch. &nbsp;It is private property.</p>

<p>The planned hike turns around here and returns the way we came. &nbsp;Those who want more mileage and altitude gain can continue along the fire road south toward the ocean before turning around.&nbsp; Alternatively, continue north on the fire road to Encinal Canyon Road.&nbsp; Refreshments will be at the trailhead.&nbsp; There is only a 5-person bench at the trailhead so please bring chairs.</p>
