<p>Directions to Trailhead: From Corona, drive south on I-15 past Lake Elsinore, to an exit named Clinton Keith. Turn right on Clinton-Keith. After about two miles, stop at the visitor center to pay $2 per person fee to Nature Conservancy custodians, and grab a map of the plateau. There are bathrooms there.</p>

<p>Then continue on the road past Hidden Valley parking area to the Vernal Spring Trailhead. Parking is along the road and there is a portapotty there.</p>

<p>The Hike: You will have a choice of several hikes, short, medium and long on the many trails throughout the plateau. Please stay within a group of 2, 3, 4 or whatever as there have been sightings of a cougar in the past. Use a hiking stick and have strong lungs.</p>

<p>Extra note: If you leave early and would like to stop for breakfast there is a Denny's in Lake Elsinore which is about 4 miles <u>before</u> the Clinton-Keith exit. Take the Diamond Drive exit off the I-15. The Denny's is on the left of the freeway</p>
