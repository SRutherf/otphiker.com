<p><b>Directions to the Trailhead:</b> Take Pacific Coast Highway west 1.9 miles past Malibu Canyon Road and turn into the Corral Canyon Park parking lot on the north side of PCH.  The parking lot is just east of the Malibu Seafood Restaurant and is easy to miss*.  It is <i>important to note</i> that there is a barrier in the middle of PCH so when we leave we need to go west to Corral Canyon Road, turn around, and head back east toward Malibu.  There is an iron ranger in the parking lot.  The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority charges $5.00 to park.  There is a restroom and picnic tables there.

<p><b>Main Hike: To Mesa Peak.</b> Start by taking the Corral Canyon Loop trail in the counterclockwise direction.  The loop junction is at 0.2 mile, turn right and continue up.  At 0.9 miles there are two faint trails on the right going up from the main trail.  Take the second one to the trail above, turn left and head north.  Continue past a trail junction at 1.15 miles reaching the Puerco Motorway at 1.65 Miles.  Continue up the Motorway until at 3.3 miles it begins to descend.  At that point go up the steep trail to the left (west) side of the road to Mesa Peak.  Return back down the motorway.  At 5.2 miles you can explore an old house without roof to the left of the road.  Continue down the road around the bend to a large flat area, cum distance here is 5.45 miles.  At that point take the trail to the west labeled Zev Yaroslavsky Coastal Slope Trail up to the junction noted above.  Turn left and continue back to the trail that goes down to the loop trail.  Turn right to finish the Corral Canyon Loop Trail back to the trailhead.  Note that it is 1.1 miles shorter to come back by the same route taken to the peak.  However, you miss the visit to the old house and don’t complete the Corral Canyon Loop Trail.

<p><b>Short Hike: Corral Canyon Loop Trail.</b> Hike this loop in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.</p>

<p><b>Main Hike Extension:</b> Shortly before Mesa Peak a trail goes southeast for .6 mile to a viewpoint overlooking Pepperdine University.  A trail goes down at that point but not sure where it ends.</p>
