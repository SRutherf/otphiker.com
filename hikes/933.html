<p>GPS Data:<br>
RT = 6.8 mi.to Paradise Cove<br>
Elevation gain 200 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take PCH 1 mile west of Kanan Dume Road to Westward Beach Road and turn left. Go about 3/4 mile to the toll booth and park on the road.  There is a restroom near the trailhead.  Refreshments will be served near where we park.  There are no picnic tables.</p>

<p>The Hike: There are headlands, cliffs, rocky coves, vast beaches, tide pools and whale watching at Point Dume.  We will walk down a road for one mile where we will ascend 250 ft. to the top of this ancient coastal bluff sand dune for an incredible view.  It is a perfect spot to watch for migrating gray whales.</p>

<p>A stairway descends on the other side of the bluff allowing access to a more isolated beach and fine tide pooling opportunities since there is a 0.2 tide at noon.  Continue on down the beach for 2 miles to Paradise Cove or beyond.  Return the way you came.  Note: for those desiring a shorter hike, go as far as you wish, and return (but don't miss the tide pools).</p>
