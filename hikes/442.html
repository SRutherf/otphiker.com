<center><h3><b>Santa Catalina Hike - Airport Road</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Transportation to the Island:  (CAUTION: Verify with the boat company that these instructions are still valid)  The boat leaves from the Long Beach Catalina Landing at 8:45 AM. Take Long Beach Fwy. south to "Downtown" exit (DO NOT TAKE "Port of Long Beach-Queen Mary" exit) stay to the right, exit at "Golden Shore" and park in the enclosed, secure parking structure.Due to the recent terrorists attack they have asked us to arrive one hour early to leave ample time for check in. Be sure to bring a picture ID. All carry-ons and baggage will be subject to inspection. Baggage needs an ID tag.</p>

<p>Senior's (&gt;55 years) get a round trip discount.</p>

<p>The Hike:  This will be the fourth time we have "hiked" Santa Catalina. Instead of our usual trek through Avalon and up to the back ridges, we will walk north-east along Crescent Drive from the boat landing and make our way up Marilla, Vieudelou and Chimes Tower Road to see the monument to Zane Grey, then out along the road to the airport until we get to a reasonable half-way place and eat our lunch.</p>

<p>After lunch, we retrace our steps and refresh ourselves at the Wooden Indian place before braving the seas on our return to the mainland.  The boat leaves Avalon at 5:15 PM. It will arrive in Long Beach about 6:15 PM.</p>
