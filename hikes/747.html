<p>Trailhead Directons: Take Angeles Crest Highway 2 to Clear Creek Junction (the junction of Angeles Crest with Angeles Forest Highway - N3) and park across the street from Clear Creek Ranger Station on Angeles Forest Hwy.</p> 

The Hike: We start up the Josephine Fire Road eventually reaching Josephine Saddle. At this point we choose an option:</p>

<p>1. Turn around at the saddle (4800 ft.) and return the way you came for a 4.8 mile RT / 1300ft. trip.</p>

<p>2. Cross the saddle and take the Colby Canyon Trail south back to the highway at the Colby Canyon trailhead, then walk a mile back to the cars on the highway.  About 6.2 miles RT / 1500 ft.</p>

<p>3. Turn left and go on to Josephine Peak (5558 ft.), retrace back to the saddle, then continue per Option 2 for a trip of 8 miles RT / 1,900 ft.</p>
 
<p>Note: The waterfalls close to the road at Colby Canyon trailhead are wonderful. Be sure to pause and enjoy their beauty.</p>
