<center><h3><b>Cloudburst Summit to Cooper Canyon</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 5.8 mile RT, approx. 1000 foot climb coming back (longer versions are feasible and are described below). Cloudburst Summit is at an elevation of 7018 feet.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: Cloudburst Summit is at mileage paddle 57.04 on Angeles Crest Highway (32.6 miles from the 210 fwy.). Park along the road.</p>

<p>The hike:  We will descend to Cooper Canyon through beautiful country.  We will reach Cooper Canyon Campground approx. 2.8 miles from start.  The people doing the "regular" hike can have their (early) lunch here by the creek and then return up the same trail to the start.</p>

<p>Those wanting a longer hike can hike along Cooper Creek another 1.1 miles (and a drop of 500 more feet) to the junction with the Burkhart Trail and turn around and go back the same way they came.  This will result in a hike of approx. 7.8 miles and an elevation gain coming back of approx. 1500 feet.</p>

<p>Note:  Although you might be tempted to go back up the Burkhart Trail to Buckhorn Campground and make the hike a shuttle hike, check beforehand to see if the road to Buckhorn Campground is closed. If it is, you would have to hike the campground road out to the highway.  If you want to go another 0.3 miles past the junction with the Burkhart Trail before turning around, you will reach the Littlerock Creek crossing.  This creek goes all the way to Littlerock Reservoir (almost to Palmdale).</p>
