<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:</strong>&nbsp; Take the 210 Freeway and exit at Baseline Road. Turn left on Baseline, and within 1 block turn right on Padua Avenue.&nbsp; In 1.7 miles turn right on Mt. Baldy Road (stop sign). &nbsp; Proceed on Mt. Baldy Road to mile marker 1.1 and look for a sign on the right marking "Barrett-Stoddard" Road.&nbsp; Turn right and park in the parking lot.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:&nbsp;</strong> The hike to the top involves mostly road-walking, with a short, rugged stretch near the peak itself.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:</strong>&nbsp; We start hiking at the intersection of the dead-end Mountain Avenue.&nbsp; Don't take the old, paved, canyon-bottom road to the south, but rather head east on the dirt road that descends past a small hydro-power plant.&nbsp; Cross San Antonio Canyon's stream and continue curving south, then east on the dirt road as it contours into Barrett Canyon.&nbsp; After 0.55 miles we come to a fork in the road ... <a href="../images/1402_description/Stoddard_Fork.jpg">take the left fork</a> that continues the uphill climb.&nbsp; After passing some picturesque cabins and yapping dogs, we arrive at a locked vehicle gate which we bypass and continue following the road. &nbsp; After curling around steep Cascade Canyon, we climb to a broad saddle (2.6 miles), where the road begins to descend lrft into the Stoddard Canyon drainage.</p>

<p>From the saddle, a faint use-trail (leads off to the right) steeply west up through tall brush to the first false summit.&nbsp; The trail then turns south along the top of a sunny ridge.&nbsp; We proceed 0.4 mile on this path, passing over another false summit, to the true summit of Stoddard Peak as marked on the Mt. Baldy topo map.&nbsp; The second false summit is actually slightly higher than Stoddard Peak (contrary to the contour lines as printed on the topo map). &nbsp; After lunch at the top, we return the way we came.</p>
