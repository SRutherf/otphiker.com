<p>Steve Babcock, Hike Leader</p>
 
<p>GPS Data:<br>
Distance: 4.2 miles RT<br>
Elevation Gain: 880 ft</p>
 
<p>Directions to Trailhead: From the westbound 210 Freeway exit at Lowell Ave and head north to Foothill Blvd. &nbsp; Turn left on Foothill, then right on Mt. Gleason Rd to Big Tujunga Canyon Rd.  Turn right and proceed to Vogel Flat Road (mileage paddle 4.34). &nbsp; Turn right down to Stonyvale Rd then left to the picnic area.  Restrooms available; national parking pass required.</p>
 
<p>From the eastbound 210 Freeway exit at Sunland Blvd, turn left under the bridge and continue east on Foothill Blvd to Oro Vista Ave. &nbsp; Turn left to the end at Big Tujunga Canyon Rd then follow instructions above.</p>
 
<p>The Hike:&nbsp; Head up canyon on the Grizzly Flat Trail crossing Big Tujunga Creek no fewer than 5 times in the first mile.&nbsp; If your rock-hopping skills are a bit rusty, be prepared to get your feet wet.&nbsp; The point where the trail leaves the canyon and starts up the mountainside is marked by a large pile of rocks.&nbsp; The second mile is very steep and rocky.&nbsp; Rest often, drink plenty of water and take in the magnificent views of Big Tujunga Canyon as you climb.&nbsp; The trail is a little overgrown with brush in spots but not bad - long pants might be advised. &nbsp; Watch out for poison oak as you approach Grizzly Flat. &nbsp; The leaves turn red in autumn so it is easy to spot.&nbsp; Take a break at Grizzly Flat then return the same way you came.</p>  
 
<p>Those wishing more mileage can continue on the Grizzly Flat fire road all the way to Angeles Crest Highway or as far as you want (See instructions for <a href="1259.html">Hike #1259).</a></p>
<p>With a 12.6 mile car shuttle, it is possible to do the 10.9 mile Grizzly Flat Traverse (See instructions for <a href="577.html">Hike #577).</a>
 
<p>Refreshments will be served on the picnic tables near the trailhead.</p>
