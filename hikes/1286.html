<p>Hike #1286<br>
Point Dume State Reserve Beach Walk<br>
August 10, 2016</p>

<p>John Chady, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
RT = 6.8 mi.to Paradise Cove<br>
Elevation gain/loss 250 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Take PCH 1 mile west of Kanan Dume Road to Westward Beach Road and turn left. Go about 3/4 mile to the toll booth and park on the road or else pay the fee ($10?) and park in the parking lot.  There is a restroom near the trailhead.  Refreshments will be served near where we park.  There are no picnic tables.</p>

<p>The Hike: There are headlands, cliffs, rocky coves, vast beaches, tide pools and whale watching at Point Dume. We will walk to the east end of the parking lot where we will ascend 250 ft. to the top of this ancient coastal bluff sand dune for an incredible view. It is a perfect spot to watch for migrating gray whales but not likely to see any.</p>

<p>A stairway descends on the other side of the bluff allowing access to a more isolated beach and some, but not the best, tide pooling opportunities since there is a 2.3 foot low tide at 8:35 AM but with a 4.5 foot high tide at 3:37 PM. Continue on down the beach for 2 miles to Paradise Cove or beyond. Return the way you came. Note: for those desiring a shorter hike, go as far as you wish, and return. It might be wise to prepare for some wet feet.</p>
