<p>Hike Overlook: Various trail combinations can be used to yield a choice of loop hikes. There are two trailheads, one beginning near the stables in Schabarum Park, the other trailhead is just off of Fullerton Road. The map <a href="http://www.habitatauthority.org/pdf/BW_Powder_Cyn_Schabarum_Pk.pdf">Powder Canyon/Schabarum Park</a> details the trail descriptions and gives distances between junctions. The terrain is rolling hills going through fresh spring grass, Oak and Black Walnut Woodlands. Wild flowers may be in bloom at this time. Intermittent creeks parallel the trails in parts of the lowlands.</p>

<p>Directions to Schabarum Trailhead: Go east on the Pomona Freeway (60). Exit at Azusa Ave. (exit #18) and go south to Colima; left on Colima; right into Schabarum Park. Drive straight past the guard booth and continue on the main park road (don't turn right). After about 0.6 mi. you will come to a "T" intersection. Turn left and in another 0.2 mi. you will arrive at an equestrian area. Park on the right.</p>

<p>Directions to Fullerton Road Trailhead: Go east on the Pomona Freeway (60). Exit at Fullerton Road (exit #19). Go 2.2 Miles south on Fullerton Road to just past Pathfinder Road. At this point, Fullerton Road becomes Harbor Boulevard. Continue south on Harbor Blvd., approx. 0.1 mile to Fullerton Road on right. Turn right on Fullerton Road and go just past the Rowland Heights Water District Facility to the trail head (on right). Please plan to car pool as there is limited parking on both sides of Fullerton Rd. near the trail head.</p>

<p>Description of Hike: Two choices are detailed out of any number of choices. Either choice creates a 7 mile loop hike with 800 ft. maximum elevation change.</p>

<p>1) From the Schabarum Trailhead, head west on the Schabarum trail to its junction with the Purple Sage trail. Turn left and follow the Purple Sage trail to its junction with the Powder Canyon trail. Turn right and follow the Powder Canyon trail around to the Nogales trail, then to the Black Walnut trail eventually ending up at the Powder Canyon trail again, Turn right and return to the trailhead.</p> 

<p>For an 8 mi. variation of this hike, instead of the making Nogales/Black Walnut transition, continue onto Fullerton Road, walk the road westerly and turn left on the Schabarum trail extension. Continue to the intersection with the Powder Canyon trail, turn right to return to the trailhead. 

<p>2) From the Fullerton Road Trailhead head north on the Nogales/Black Walnut trail and the Powder Canyon trail until reaching the Purple Sage trail junction. Turn left and follow the Purple Sage trail eventually transitioning onto the Buena Vista trail and then to the Schabarum trail. Turn right and proceed to Schabarum Park. Go south on the Powder Canyon trail turning left on the Schabarum trail extension and following this trail out to Fullerton Road. Turn right, and follow the road back to the trailhead.
