<p><b>Directions to Trailhead:</b><br>
a) From Los Angeles head west on the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) to its end and continue north on Pacific Coast Highway. Turn north (right) on Temescal Canyon Road and drive 1.1 miles, cross Sunset Blvd. and into Temescal Gateway Park.<br>
b) Going <b>south</b> on Pacific Coast Highway, turn east (left) on Sunset Blvd., and continue through Pacific Palisades to Temescal Canyon Road, turn left (north) into the parking area.<br>
c) From 405 Fwy. go west on Sunset Blvd. to Pacific Palisades and turn right into Temescal Gateway Park.</p>

<p><strong>The parking fee is </strong><b>now $12</b>.&nbsp; Street parking along Temescal Canyon Rd. is a possibility if you don't mind walking a few hundred yards up and across Sunset Blvd.&nbsp; Parking on Sunset is limited to two hours.&nbsp; And please be <b>aware of the stop signs</b> around the parking area; they have cameras, so come to a full stop (the fine was $175).&nbsp; Restrooms are in two locations: the lower parking lot and near the campus store.</p>

<p><b>The Hike:</b>&nbsp; Walk up the canyon on the landscaped path past the restrooms.&nbsp; The footpath soon crosses a branch of Temescal Creek.&nbsp; Continue through the canyon.&nbsp; The path ascends moderately to another footbridge and a close-up view of a small waterfall.&nbsp; The path steepens and climbs westward up Temescal Ridge to a signed junction with Temescal Ridge Trail.&nbsp; Continue uphill a half-mile to Skull Rock.&nbsp; Some might want to turn around here, the others can continue on to the Antenna Site, Temescal Peak and even Eagle Rock via Fire Road 30.&nbsp; Return is either retracing your steps through the canyon, or else via the Ridge Trail to the parking lot.</p>
