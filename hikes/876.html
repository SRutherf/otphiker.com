<p><strong>GPS Data:</strong><br>
Basic Hike: RT = 4.9 mi., Elevation Gain = 450 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The basic hike goes up the Backbone - Saddle Peak trails to Saddle Peak, then turns around and returns via Stunt Road past the trailhead and on to Topanga Lookout and return to the trailhead.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:</strong><br>
<strong>Directions from the 101 Freeway:</strong> Exit at Valley Circle/Mulholland. Go south on Valley Circle and continue past commercial area to traffic light at Valmar. Turn right and continue 1 mile to Mulholland Highway.  Turn right. Go 3.6 miles and turn left on Stunt Road. Follow Stunt Road 3.9 miles to intersection of Stunt/Saddle Peak and Schueren Road, and park. </p>

<p><strong>Directions from PCH:</strong> Drive north, turn right on Topanga Canyon, SR-27, 3.8 miles. Turn left onto Fernwood Pacific Drive, 1.5 miles. Road name changes to 
Tuna Canyon Road, 1.3 Miles. Bear right (north-west) onto Saddle Peak Road, 2.7 Miles. Park at junction of Stunt/Saddle Peak and Schueren Roads.</p>

<p><strong>Hike Description:</strong>Hike west on Stunt Road for 200 yards.  The Saddle Peak segment of the Backbone Trail angles left leaving Stunt Road and continues to a ridge 
crossing over to the south side. Continue almost level until you see a large water tank ahead.  Go up the driveway and around the left side of and behind the tank to follow an uphill trail to a level area (Saddle Peak Saddle) and a fork in the trail (indicated by a yellow sign marking a Government Property Boundary). At this point we leave the Backbone Trail by taking the <u>left fork</u> - West Saddle Peak Road (dirt) to continue on to Saddle Peak, always taking the right-hand option at other forks along the way to the peak complex.</p>

<p>Return to the saddle and retrace your steps back to and past the trailhead, heading northeast on a fire road leading to the Topanga lookout, a large concrete water collection tank totally and colorfully graffitied. The view of the surrounding countryside to the north is magnificant. Return the way you came.</p>

<p>A short distance past the trailhead, on the lookout fire road, the Backbone Trail continues off to the south (sign legend: "Fossil Ridge, 0.6 mi Hondo Canyon, 4.2 mi Old Topanga Road") which climbs the south side of the ridge and presents many large Scallop shell fossils along the trail. This is an option for increasing mileage on the hike. Return to trailhead.</p>
