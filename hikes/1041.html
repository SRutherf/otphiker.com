<center><h3><b>Las Virginas View Trail to the Bark Park at Las Virginas Road - Shuttle</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance - Short Hike: 4.8 mi. RT. Mid-distance hike: 6.0 mi. one-way. Additional distance can be achieved by detouring from the mid-distance hike along the New Millennium Trail as far as you wish. Max. Elevation gain = 700 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: From PCH: Take Malibu Canyon/Las Virgenes Roads north to the intersection with the Mulholland Highway.  Park in the area at the north-east corner of this intersection.</p>

<p>From 101 Ventura Fwy: Take Las Virgenes Canyon Road south to Mulholland Highway, turn left and park. There are no restrooms at the trailhead. Toilets are at the McDonald’s at the West side of Las Virgenes Road, just south of the 101 Ventura Fwy and there is a port-a-potty at the Bark Park </p>

<p>The Shuttle: All hikes end at the Bark Park located just east off of Las Virginas Road, about 2.5 miles north of the trailhead. Some cars must be pre-positioned at the bark park to bring the car-pool drivers back to the trailhead to pick up their cars.
  
<p>The Hike:<br>
Short Hike: Begin by heading north on the trail that meanders through waist high fields of grass, shoulder high patches of wild mustard, groves of trees and beautiful views of the surrounding hills and canyons. At a junction at 2 miles, turn right and ascend to the peak (0.4 miles) and return either the way you came or the loop back to the junction. Turn left to go back to the trail head. Car pool to Bark Park for refreshments.</p> 

<p>Mid-Distance Hike: Begin as above for the short hike. At the junction at 2 miles, turn left and continue to the view point. The trail for the most part from here to the Bark Park trail follows a ridge and traverses up and down some canyons. At a junction at 3-1/4 miles, turn right, then after ¼ mile, turn left onto Norm’s Way Trail. (When scouted, there were 2 faded cones at the junction).  Continue for about another mile to a sign marking the junction with the Bark Park trail and the New Millennium trail. Turn left and proceed 1.5 miles to the Bark Park. 

<p>Longer Option: To extend the hike, turn right instead of left at the signed junction of the Bark Park and New Millennium trails. Proceed out and back as far as you wish along the New Millennium trail, returning to the Bark Park.</p>

<p>Refreshments at the Bark Park.</p>

<p><b>CAUTION: Beware of ticks.</b> When scouted, the hikers discovered that the high grasses proved to be a "mother lode" for ticks. They are said to be prevalent from October to April, but they were still around in late June.</p>
