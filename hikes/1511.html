<p><strong>Basic Hike:</strong> Starts at the picnic area across the street from the &quot;Trails&quot; Cafe.&nbsp;There are restrooms in the picnic area. There are two trails heading north-east leading up to the Observatory, the Upper and the Lower Trail. Take either one up and the other one down on the return trip. &nbsp; Both will meet just below the observatory at a multi-point junction.  Take the widest trail up the middle to end up at the Observatory.&nbsp; At the Observatory there are multiple restrooms near the parking area.&nbsp; Those doing the <strong>short hike</strong> can retrace their steps from here.</p>
<p>For those doing the <strong>basic or extended hikes</strong>, continue through the parking lot to the far end and the nicely landscaped Charlie Turner Trailhead.&nbsp; After the Berlin Forest, the trail descends to a concrete bridge over a saddle. &nbsp; Continue on the fire road to the left (Charlie Turner Trail). &nbsp; This will take you on a wide looping trail with views of  Mt. Lee and the Hollywood sign.&nbsp; You will reach a 6 -way cross roads with a sign pointing to two options around to the back to the top of Mt. Hollywood.&nbsp; The left road takes you past the Captain's Roost.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right road will take you past   Dante's View,  a terraced 2 acre garden planted by Dante Orgolini in the 1960&rsquo;s. This south-facing garden has picnic benches and shade trees along its intertwining trail and makes an excellent place for lunch.&nbsp;  Either path takes you to the top of Mt. Hollywood.&nbsp; Along the way you will have  commanding view of San Fernando Valley, the Los Angeles Basin, and the San Gabriel Mountains.&nbsp; For the <strong>basic hike</strong>, return the way you came.</p>

<p><strong>Option #2:&nbsp;</strong> For those wishing extra miles, head west from Mt. Hollywood to the Mullholland Trail and the Mt. Lee Drive to Mt. Lee and the Hollywood sign.&nbsp; <strong>Northern green trail on the Google map</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Option #3:&nbsp;</strong> From Mt. Hollywood, return to the trailhead via the Western Canyon (<strong>southern green trail on the Google map</strong>). After passing over the concrete bridge over the saddle, take the right trail signposted to Fern Dell, and continue on the Western Canyon trail to Fern Dell Drive and the trailhead.</p>
<p><strong>Option #4:&nbsp;</strong> Return from Mt. Hollywood via the Hogback Trail and the Greek Theatre.&nbsp; <strong>Eastern blue trail on the Google map</strong>.&nbsp; Includes an additional four peaks, Baby Bell, Mount Bell, Hogback Peak and Glendale Peak.</p>
<p><strong>Option #5:</strong>&nbsp; Those wishing to do the Fern Dell walk, can tack it onto the beginning or the end of the day.&nbsp; Head back down the Fern Dell trail from the picnic area. The narrow trail is arguably one of the most charming and lush in the area and will take you through stream areas with hanging plants and over little bridges. The meandering area is home to over 50 fern species. The trail is 0.7 miles round trip and ends (or begins) at the wooden sign &quot;Fern Dell&quot; at the bottom of Fern Dell Drive.</p>
