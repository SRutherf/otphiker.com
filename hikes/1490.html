  <strong>Naples History and  Neighborhood: </strong><br>
  <br>
  This hike is on flat, paved walkways.&nbsp; There is no shade, but it has a great variety  of architecture of private homes and beautiful gardens along the canals.&nbsp; Most walks are next to water, beach or canal,  with many boats to admire.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  The idea began in 1904 when the father-and-son team, Arthur  Parsons, announced plans for a &quot;Venetian-style&quot; community that  featured a series of canals and pedestrian walkways.&nbsp; To accomplish this, they enclosed, dredged,  filled in, and stabilized a marshland with concrete bulkheads to create the  seaside neighborhood.&nbsp; The first 6 houses  were built as speculative homes.&nbsp;  Waterfront lots in Naples ranged from $900 to $4,000, which was costly  at the time.&nbsp; In 1907, the Parsons  partnered with oil-and rail baron Henry Huntington, to incorporate a stop at  Naples on the Pacific Electric Railroad's Newport Line. <br>
  <br>
  If you want to spend more time in the area, the art museum  or a stroll on 2nd St with many shops and restaurants are interesting. There is  also the MOLAA (Museum of Latin American Art) just down the street on Alamitos  Ave.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Basic Hike (Red Track):</strong><br>
<br>
We meet at the corner 54th Place and  Ocean Blvd.&nbsp; Walk north on 54th Place to join Bay Shore Ave along  Alamitos Bay Beach.&nbsp; Cross Second St and  continue walking along Bay Shore Ave until Appian Way.&nbsp; Cross the street and turn right to walk on  Appian Way over the small bridge to the large bridge. Pass under the large  bridge and look to your left.&nbsp; At the  start of the parking lot you will see a railing and sidewalk that follows along  the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; Walk along this railing  through the marina, past the Yacht Club, and past the small park. You will now be  walking on a walkway in front of the houses on the water.&nbsp; When the sidewalk turns and heads into the  canals of Naples, continue and start to count your bridges.&nbsp; The canals are circular, and the bridges are  like the spokes of a wheel.&nbsp; You will go  up and over each bridge, exiting on the fourth bridge, which is The Toledo.  Turn right and walk on this street until it ends at Second Street.&nbsp; Turn left and walk over the bridge, turning  left again on Bayshore to return to where you started.<br>
