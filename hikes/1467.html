<p>Distance: 8 mi. RT<br>
Elevation gain: 1,500 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>&nbsp; Take the 118 west and exit on Yosemite (2nd exit after Rocky Peak).&nbsp; Go north ½ mile and turn right on Flanagan Drive.&nbsp; Go ¾ miles to the end and park on the street.&nbsp; There are no restrooms at the trailhead, but there is a gas station and a McDonalds as you get off the freeway on the left side of the road.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike: </strong>&nbsp; We start up the Chumash trail which intersects Rocky Peak Road at 2.7 miles.&nbsp; Turn right and continue south on the Rocky Peak Road.&nbsp; In about 0.6 mi bypass the signed intersection with the Johnson Motorway.&nbsp; Continue on Rocky Peak Road for another 0.75 mi then look for a use trail that leads off to the left over and around a small peak (West Peak) (<a href="../aerialphotomaps/RockyPeakDetail.jpg">See Detail of Rocky Peak Access Trail</a>).&nbsp; Only after getting around West Peak can Rocky Peak be seen.&nbsp; Continue on the trail down onto a saddle between the two peaks then proceed to scramble up the rocks to Rocky Peak.&nbsp; We return to the trailhead the way we came.</p>

<p><strong>Shorter Option:</strong> Turn around wherever you want!</p>

<p><b>Caution:</b> The "connector trail" shown in the photo connecting the Hummingbird Trailhead to the Chumash Trailhead resulted from a hike exploring a loop hike combining the two trails.&nbsp; Recent construction in this area may preclude hiking this path.</p>
