  <br>
  <strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>&nbsp; Go to the southern end of Harbor Fwy (110) to  Gaffey Street, San Pedro exit, South (left) on Gaffey to 9th Street West,  (right) on 9th Street to Western Avenue (1.4 mile).&nbsp; Cross Western and  turn left in half a block onto Friendship Park Drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the  parking lot by taking the first right turn.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Friendship Park, our starting point and party  place has a locked gate and a sign that says open at 8am.&nbsp; Park personnel say it is normally open a  little earlier than that.&nbsp; The same is true  for the restroom near the far end of the parking lot. The Nature Center opens  at 9am. Park at the far end of the parking lot, and party at the numerous  tables just below the lot. &nbsp;For some, hiking the numerous trails of the  park will be enough. &nbsp;Most will descend from the Park high point down the western &quot;bust your buns trail&quot; (so named on the map), to the trails along the  ocean and Trump Golf Course.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Hike:&nbsp; </strong>The hike has been revised from the November 14, 2018, <a href="1385.html">#1385 hike</a>, because in mid 2021 a landslide resulted  in the closure of a portion of the Catalina Trail, as it enters the area  to the south-east of the Trump Golf Course.<br>
<br>
Begin the hike behind and above the Nature  Center.&nbsp; The trail <strong>(blue track)</strong> leads up the hill and  then down to Palos Verdes Drive South via the western &quot;bun buster&quot; trail..&nbsp;  Cross the drive, and proceed down the path into the Ocean Trails Reserve,  (aka Palos Verdes Shoreline Park). After the fast descent levels off, bear  right at a narrow but well-defined path, or a bit later at a trail signed as  Shoreline Park Trail.&nbsp; As you proceed  west, notice the trail ahead that climbs the ridge toward a row of houses <strong>(dark red track)</strong>.  After crossing the dry creek bottom the basic hike branches right, and up the  ridge toward the houses. <br>
<br>
<strong>Extended Hike:</strong> At this point the Rabbits will need more, so  they should branch left<strong> (purple track)</strong>. This will lead down the Shoreline Park or Gnat Catcher  trail and ultimately to the Sagebrush, Catalina, and bottom end of the East  Portal trails.&nbsp; It is at this junction of  the Catalina and East Portal trails that the Catalina is closed because of the  landslide. The Rabbits should follow the East Portal Trail up until it rejoins  the basic hike at the obvious stairway <strong>(dark red track)</strong><br>
<br>
The basic hike<strong> </strong>reaches the East Portal Trail at  the top of the ridge near the houses <strong>(dark red track)</strong>.&nbsp;  Proceed toward the ocean and ascend the stairs just as the trail makes a  hard left.&nbsp; The stairs lead us to what is  essentially the junction of Twin Harbors Drive and La Rotonda Drive.&nbsp; Proceed down La Rotonda to the parking lot, public  restrooms, and the Trump golf course.&nbsp;  Follow the public paved &ldquo;Trail and Bike Way&rdquo; down to the junction with the Catalina  Trail.&nbsp; It is this junction that is the  western end of the Catalina Trail closure.</p>
<p>For an optional visit to the beach take the Dudleya Trail <strong>(dark blue track)</strong>. The beach is covered with dozens of stone pile &quot;ducks.&quot;</p>
<p>Continue to follow the Catalina Trail west <strong>(dark red track)</strong> and when we are  close to being even with the golf course flag, take the unidentified Sunrise  Trail down to the water <strong>(light green track)</strong>.&nbsp; Round the point  on the unimproved, but quite adequate trail extension.&nbsp; You should get your boots wet only for the  highest of tides.&nbsp; The Sunset Trail up to  the public Founders Park is then obvious.&nbsp;  Or, one could extend the hike by continuing down and back on the beach,  before ascending to the park.&nbsp; The park  has benches and tables and is a good rest place. The Trump golf clubhouse is  directly above the park, and public restrooms are adjacent to the cart  maintenance area.<br>
  <br>
Return to the party and our cars by proceeding back  on the Catalina Trail and retracing our steps, possibly by going east on Palos Verdes Drive at the end of La Rotunda Drive.&nbsp;Take the eastern &quot;bun buster&quot; trail back up to the Nature Center <strong>(light green track)</strong>.</p>
