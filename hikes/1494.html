<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong> We will meet at the Griffith Park  Merry-Go-Round upper lot.&nbsp; From I-5 north take Griffith Park exit, turn  right on Crystal Springs Drive then left at the Merry-Go-Round sign.&nbsp; From  I-5 south take the Los Feliz west exit, turn right on Los Feliz, turn right on  Crystal Springs Drive then left at the Merry-Go-Round sign.&nbsp; Restrooms are  available nearby, as are pony rides!<br>
<br>
<strong>Basic Hike (5.6 miles RT,  1,464 ft. elevation gain):&nbsp;</strong> Take the Fern Canyon Nature Trail to Fern Canyon Trail and  turn left up to 5 Points.&nbsp; Take the first left to Beacon Hill for a short detour if desired.  Otherwise, follow the sign to the Joe Klass water stop  with shade trees and tables.&nbsp; Turn right on paved Vista Del Valle Drive  and walk on the road for a short distance.&nbsp; Look for a green wooden pump  house on the left located at the junction of Riverside and Hogback  Trails.&nbsp; Bear right on the Hogback Trail. Turn right to Glendale Peak for short detour if desired. Return to Hogback Trail for a steep ascent up the ridge to Dante&rsquo;s  View and Mt. Hollywood.&nbsp;Take a rest and appreciate the panaramic view. </p>
<p>Descend from Mt. Hollywood and follow the North Trail keeping right at two  junctions (follow signs for Bee Rock) down to Vista Del Valle again.&nbsp; Turn  right and walk down the pavement a short distance past a water stop to the Bill  Eckert Trail on the left.&nbsp; Follow this down to the Old Zoo area, past the Bee Rock  Trail to take the Upper Old Zoo Trail back to the parking lot.&nbsp; It may become a little confusing in the Old  Zoo area, but just head towards the Merry-Go-Round (using Google Maps if necessary)..&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Short Option (3.3 miles):&nbsp;</strong> Take the Fern Canyon Trail up to 5  Points, then return via the Coolidge and Lower Beacon Trails.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Long Option (6.6  miles):&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Take  Lower Beacon and Coolidge Trails to 5 Points, then follow the Basic Hike  instructions from there.</p>
