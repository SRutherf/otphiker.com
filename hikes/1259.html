<p>Hike #1259<br>
Grizzly Flat from Angeles Crest Highway<br>
February 3, 2016</p>

<p>Mike Savoia, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
RT = 6.7 miles<br>
Elevation gain/loss = 2305 ft.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: From the 210 Freeway drive north on Angeles Crest Hwy. (Route 2) 6.2 miles to a parking area on the left (north) side of the road - mileage paddle 30.64.</p>

<p>The Hike:&nbsp; Climb some 430 ft. in the first mile, then descend 890 ft. to Grizzly Flat. Along the way we will have an excellent view of Tujunga Canyon as we descend the escape route used by Tiburcio Vasquez in his early raids on the ranchers of Los Angeles.&nbsp; Return the same way.</p>

<p>Grizzly Flat sits on the crest of the divide between the Arroyo Seco and Big Tujunga watersheds amid a grove of pines planted by the Forest Service after a fire in 1958.&nbsp; A faint, unmarked trail goes off to the right to Vasquez Creek in about 1/4 mile.&nbsp; There is no trail along Vasquez Creek but you can follow the creek a short distance in either direction.</p>
