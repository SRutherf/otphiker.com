<p>Our hike will begin at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center. Located next to Point Vicente Lighthouse, this small natural history museum is an ideal whale-watching spot. Exhibits highlight the peninsula's geology, flora and fauna.  The hike will be a six and a half mile loop with minimal elevation gain.  We will explore the area around and thru the Terranea Resort heading down to the shoreline and explore the coastal cliffs.  If the weather cooperates, the shoreline and ocean views are magnificent.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: From the 405 Freeway take Hawthorne Boulevard South, up and over “The Hill” to end of Hawthorne Blvd. at Palos Verdes Drive West.  Turn left at the traffic light. (where you’ll find a “Starbucks” for coffee).  Turn right at the next turn off, which will be the entrance to Point Vicente Interpretive Center, and park in the parking lot.</p>

<p>If you take the 110 Freeway, go South to the Pacific Coast Hwy off-ramp and head West.  Turn left when you come to Hawthorne Blvd. and follow the directions listed above.</p>

<p>Note: There are restrooms available at the park, after 9am. And at Terranea Resort.</p>
