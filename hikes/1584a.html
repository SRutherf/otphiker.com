<p>Basic Hike (magenta): RT = 6.8 miles; Cum Elevation = 810 ft.<br>
Optional shorter or longer versions (green)<br>
<br>
  <strong>Directions to Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The  trailhead is the parking lot adjacent to the Peninsula Education Foundation  office at 300 Paseo del Mar.&nbsp; Reach the trailhead by exiting the 405  freeway and heading South on Hawthorne Blvd.&nbsp; About half way up the Palos  Verdes hill turn right on Palos Verdes Dr. North.&nbsp; Continue West 2.4 miles  to the triangular intersection and bear left as Palos Verdes Dr. transitions  from North to West.&nbsp; Continue a block through the Malaga Cove commercial  district and turn right at Via Corta, which curves into Via Almar.&nbsp; Turn  right from Via Almar onto Via Arroyo and after a block turn right into the trailhead  parking lot. Rest rooms are available to the South, across the expanse of  grass.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong>The Basic Hike makes  a loop and returns to the trailhead.&nbsp; The hike begins up the small road,  transitions to a trail, and then onto city streets as it progresses in front of  the Malaga Cove commercial district.&nbsp; (From the open area look up the hill  and you can see the cut for the fire road we will be on later.)&nbsp; Continue  on Via Tejon to a large open area, bounded by Palos Verdes Drive North and  Palos Verdes Golf Course on the East.<br>
  <br>
  There are a multitude of trails in this open area. Stay along the  crest until you reach the golf course and their &ldquo;Keep Out&rdquo; signs.&nbsp; Some  may choose to return from here, but the main hike soon heads south up a heavy  foliaged streambed, which is below power lines.&nbsp; After crossing below the  bridge for Via Campesina, turn right and continue on the Paseo del Sol fire  road, (it&rsquo;s the cut seen earlier from below).<br>
  <br>
  Continue as Paseo del Sol turns from a fire road to a real road  and crosses Via del Monte.&nbsp; The Basic Hike continues up Paseo del Sol and  turns downward on the trail after 1821 Paseo del Sol.&nbsp; The trail  progresses to Palos Verdes Dr. West.&nbsp; Turn right, as the hike follows the  median until it ends.&nbsp; Cross Palos Verdes Dr. West to the small parking  lot and &ldquo;Viewpoint&rdquo;.&nbsp; Continue North East on the trail as it parallels  Palos Verdes Drive West.&nbsp; After about  half a mile its &nbsp;probably best to cross a  brushy canyon on a walkway next to the Drive.&nbsp;  Very soon after the walkway, drop down to &nbsp;Paseo Del Mar.&nbsp;  Another quarter of a mile will expose a wide open area of the bluff,  which is the start of the Bluff Cove Trail which leads down to the sea.&nbsp; After returning from the Cove, Paseo Del Mar will  be mainly residential street but partially bluff trail, as it returns us to our  trailhead. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Shorter Hikes:</strong> The first of the two shorter hike possibilities saves distance as  we &nbsp;approach the Palos Verdes Golf  Club.&nbsp; The second and major hike shortner  continues down Via Del Monte, as the basic hike transitions from Del Sol Fire  Road to Paseo Del Sol.&nbsp; It soon passes La  Venta Inn, a well known wedding and party venue. Continue through the La Venta  Inn parking lot and merge with Via Somonte until, across from 820 Via Somonte  take the downward path and stairs. Walk up Via del Monte and turn right and follow  Via Arriba, and then the path and downward stairs across from 1704 Via  Arriba.&nbsp; At the bottom of the stairs turn  hard right and follow the path back to the Malaga Cove commercial district, and  then back to the trailhead.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Longer Hikes:</strong> For a longer hike, from the viewpoint on Palos Verdes Drive West  turn left onto the Blufftop Trail, for an additional three quarters of mile and  then return.&nbsp; For another option for  additional distance descend on the small paved road just past the trailhead parking  lot.&nbsp; This leads past the Palos Verdes  Beach and Athletic Club to the Malaga Cove Trail and then to RAT Beach.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
  Party on the nice grass under large shade trees adjacent to the  parking lot.&nbsp; There are no tables or  benches, so bringing folding chairs would be a good idea.<br>
