<p><strong>Hike #1389<br>
  Trump Golf Course to Royal Palms County Beach<br>
  January 9, 2019</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Peter Wall</strong></p>

<p><strong>Meet at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am</strong></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.&nbsp; This will avoid the inconvenience and save costs to the hike leader.</strong></font></p>

<p> Distance: About 7 miles RT.&nbsp; Out and back.&nbsp; Elevation gain: About 700 ft.&nbsp; There is a public rest room at  the start.&nbsp; Hike includes bluff walk, sloped trails, street walking, possible beach walking.  </p>
<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead:</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p>From Far Away:&nbsp; South on the Harbor Freeway (SR-110) towards San Pedro to freeway&rsquo;s end  at Gaffey Street, turn left onto Gaffey.&nbsp; To avoid downtown, turn right on 1st street, then left on Western  (213).&nbsp; Turn right on W. 25th Street (which continues as Palos Verdes Drive at the end).&nbsp; Go about 2 miles  to La Rotonda Drive (small sign), turn left towards ocean and follow it downhill to the end.&nbsp; Turn right  into the public parking area. &nbsp; </p>
<p>From South Bay: South towards ocean on Hawthorne Blvd, then left on Palos Verdes Drive.&nbsp; Turn right  onto La Rotonda Drive, then right into the public parking area. </p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> The Lakeview Trail / Bike Way trailhead starts at the restrooms at the end of the parking area. &nbsp; As we walk through the golf course area, there are gray concrete paths for hiking and faded peach tinted  concrete paths for golf.&nbsp; Stay off of the peach golf paths.  </p>
<p><strong>Out = Up the El Porto Trail to a pillbox, across top of canyon to E. Boundary Trail</strong></p>
<p> At the bluff above the beach, turn left.&nbsp; Near here, our main hike takes the first trail to the left &ndash; see three  big rocks (near intersection of the Switchbacks Trail down to water).&nbsp; Hike up the hill to see the pillbox  remnants tight against houses &ndash; see where the cable is pulled down.&nbsp; Also good view of golf course. &nbsp; Continue on trail past the pillbox.&nbsp; The trail will turn right at base of some stairs.&nbsp; Do not take stairs. &nbsp; Along the trail, look for opening in cabled trail, with sign.&nbsp; Turn right.&nbsp; This trail goes down and across  canyon to a wide E. Boundary Trail on opposite side.&nbsp; Cross the Shoreline/Gnat Catcher/etc. trails -- just  stay on the same trail until you get across and dead end onto the E. Boundary Trail.&nbsp; Turn right to get back  down to the bluff.&nbsp; At the ocean, turn left to continue. &nbsp; We then pass in front of a trailer park (notice Sotheby sale).&nbsp; The trail ends/turns left (see vegetable  garden on left) and you walk straight onto Warmouth Street.&nbsp; Go left on Stargazer Avenue and right on  Paseo del Mar which goes to Royal Palms/White Point County Beach. &nbsp; Choose to descend to water or not.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nice on top too.&nbsp; See the great geological example of California on  the driveway down-earth folded like a pancake several times over, a prime example of wave cut  platforms.&nbsp; There also used to be a natural sulfur spring here, and it was a resort destination for that reason  around 1915.&nbsp; See printout of history at refreshments.  </p>
<p><strong>Back = Up and around difficult steps via Shoreline Park/Gnat Catcher Trails.  </strong></p>
<p>Retrace steps except turn up hill at Shoreline Park/Gnat Catcher Trail which is a little past the E.  Boundary Trail where you came down on your way out.&nbsp; Important: this loop avoids the steep/step trail  closer to the bluff. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Extra. Go Down to Water: there is a steep Switchbacks Trail, access to beach, near the trail from the  parking lot and the Pillbox turnoff.&nbsp; (Plus two more closer to Trump.)&nbsp; Also, a map I saw showed climbing  up from beach at Royal Palms to Paseo del Mar.&nbsp; Take a look to see about  walking along base of cliff.</p>
<p>Suggestion:&nbsp; For refreshments in parking lot, bring chairs as there is no place to sit.</p>
