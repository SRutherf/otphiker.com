<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead (497 ft asl):&nbsp; </strong>From  PCH take Malibu Canyon north until 0.2 miles before Piuma Road. The parking lot is on your left.&nbsp; From the 101, take Malibu Canyon south until 0.2 miles past Piuma Road. The parking lot will be on your right. This is in the Malibu Creek State Park so there is a an $8 parking fee. Bring your State Golden Bear Pass. No restrooms or picnic benches at the trailhead so bring chairs.</p>
<p><strong>Hike Description:</strong>&nbsp; The hike is mostly along the Backbone Trail. After 0.6 miles the trail meets the Mesa Peak Motorway. Take the left turn. This part of the hike is relatively steep but mostly shady in the morning. After 2.4 miles from the traiilhead (and a gain of 1,383 ft), you will hit another major intersection. You now have two choices.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1 - Corral Canyon Trailhead and Castro Crest (Longer):</strong>&nbsp; Turn right and continue along the Mesa Peak Motorway (still part of the Backbone Trail)&nbsp;for another 2.4 miles until you reach some great rock formations on the right called Castro Crest (2,230 ft asl). Take the minor trail to the right and spend some time wondering around these rock formations including a large stone spiral. Continue on for another 0.4 miles to the Corral Canyon Trailhead (1,997 ft asl) and have a well deserved lunch. Return to the trailhead by retracing your steps.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2 - Puerco Motorway to Mesa Peak (Shorter):</strong>&nbsp; Turn left and continue on Puerco Motorway for 0.4 miles to Mesa Peak (1,826 ft asl).&nbsp; Continue further down Puerco Motorway if you want more miles otherwise return to the trailhead by retracing your steps.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1.</strong> 10.0 miles, 2,400 feet.<br>
<strong>Option 2. </strong>5.8 miles, 1,500 feet. </p>
