<p><strong>Hike #1582<br>
August 14, 2024<br> 
Crystal 
Cove Beach &amp; Trails</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hike Leader:&nbsp; Bob DeWolf</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meet at 8:00 am for start at 8:30 am</strong><br>
<strong>Rabbits start at a time to be determined </strong></p>

<p><strong>Driving Directions: </strong>Take  the 55 Freeway South toward Newport Beach.&nbsp; Take the 73 toll road SE to  Macarthur Blvd. No toll is charged if you get off at Macarthur.&nbsp; Follow Macarthur 2.1 miles S. to Pacific  Coast Highway (PCH). Turn left on PCH.&nbsp;  After you turn you will see the signs to Crystal Cove (3 miles).&nbsp; Crystal Cove has a number of beachside  parking lots. We will meet at the south end of the Reef Point parking lot near  the restroom. Reef Point is on the right 1.5 miles beyond Newport Coast Drive.  Turn right at Reef Point and stop at the kiosk to pay for parking.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Parking: </strong>Senior parking is $14 but passes are  available that will avoid the fee.&nbsp; Most  public libraries in our areas have a limited number of passes that you can  check out with your library card the same way you do for books.&nbsp; The State sells passes but they must be  purchased in advance.<br>
  <br>
  After paying or showing your pass continue down the road and  turn left.&nbsp; Continue to the end of the  road and park near the restroom.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Hike: </strong>Meet near the  restroom.&nbsp; Take the ramp down to the  beach and turn right.&nbsp; Continue past  cottages long ago restored, some recently restored and some currently being  restored.&nbsp; You can book some of these but  it's difficult.&nbsp; They are just too  popular. You will also pass the Beachcomber restaurant and the Shake Shack (up  on the hill).&nbsp; Continue on the beach to  the cave (at the end).&nbsp; After you have  experienced the cave, go back the way you came a little way and turn left up  the stairs and left again. This will  take you to a nice viewpoint over Little Treasure Cove.<br>
  <br>
  Go back down to the beach and return the way you came. Alternatively you could walk back up on the  bluff.&nbsp; I recommend against this as it is  longer and warmer. The hike, as described is about 5 miles. When you get back  to Reef Point and if you want to walk another mile, continue down the beach to  the end and return before going up to the parking lot.&nbsp; If you're still not tired enough you can go  through the tunnel to Moro Canyon and hike there, but it will likely be hot.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>After Hiking:</strong> We will gather after the hike on the  South side of the parking lot. There are no tables, benches or shade, but  there is usually a nice sea breeze here and you can sit on the folding chair  you brought.
