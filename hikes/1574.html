<p><strong>Description of the Hike:</strong>&nbsp;  There are a number of variations for this hike.&nbsp; The terrain is rolling  hills going through trails and fire roads.&nbsp; You will see Oak and Black  Walnut Woodlands, native scrub brush and hopefully great views of the San  Gabriel Mountains.&nbsp; We start at a wooded and shaded park area and climb  gently to over 1300&rsquo;, where views can be stunning on clear days.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Directions to Schabarum Trailhead:&nbsp;</strong>  Go east on the Pomona Freeway (60). Exit at Azusa Ave. (exit #18) and go south  to Colima; left on Colima; right into Schabarum Park.&nbsp; Drive straight past  the guard booth and continue on the main park road (don't turn right).&nbsp;  After about 0.6 mi. you will come to a &quot;T&quot; intersection. Turn left  and follow the signs to the Equestrian Area.&nbsp; In another 0.2 mi. you will  arrive at the equestrian area.&nbsp; Park on the right.&nbsp; Bathrooms and  picnic tables are available at the park.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Basic Hike:&nbsp;</strong> 6.3 miles, about 1300 feet total  elevation gain &ndash; From the Schabarum Trailhead, head south (past the horse  corrals) on Powder Canyon Trail for 0.8 miles to the junction with the Black  Walnut Trail on the left.&nbsp; Follow Black Walnut Trail 1.0 miles to turnoff  to Nogales Trail (on the right).&nbsp; Take Nogales Trail a short .12 miles to  join Powder Canyon Trail, which is a dirt road at this point.&nbsp; Go right on  Powder Canyon and continue for 0.8 miles to the junction (on the left) with the  Purple Sage Trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Go left and follow Purple Sage Trail for 1.4 miles, past some antenna  stations on your right, to a clump of eucalyptus trees on the left.&nbsp; This  may be a good place for a break with shade and a nice view of the OC.&nbsp; As  you depart, turn north following the trail wrapping around the antenna hill and  you will reach the intersection with the Schabarum trail. Turn right and follow  this trail for 2.1 miles to return to the starting point.&nbsp; (Use caution  after 0.7 miles on the Schabarum Trail to make sure you stay on it as you round  an area with transmission towers).&nbsp; When you descend back to the edge of  the park, be sure to veer right to stay on the Schabarum trail, which will  bring you back to the equestrian area.

  <strong>Variations on the Basic Hike:</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>a)&nbsp;Shorter Hike 1:&nbsp;</strong>5.4 miles, about 1,200 feet total elevation  gain &ndash; Follow Basic Hike above until you reach the junction of Purple Sage  Trail and Buena Vista Trail&nbsp; (just before  the first antenna tower cluster).&nbsp; Proceed straight ahead on the Buena  Vista Trail to join the Schabarum Trail without going around the transmitter  hill.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>b)&nbsp;Shorter Hike 2:&nbsp;</strong>3.4 miles, about 550 feet total elevation  gain &ndash; Follow the Basic Hike above on its first loop:&nbsp; Powder Canyon,  Black Walnut Trail, Nogales Trail and Powder Canyon.&nbsp; At the junction with  Purple Sage Trail, continue on Powder Canyon to return to the start.<br>
  <br>
<strong>c)&nbsp;Longer Hike:</strong>&nbsp;8.5 miles, about 1,500 feet total elevation  gain &ndash; Start along Powder Canyon south as on the basic hike. &nbsp; About 0.2  miles turn left onto Schabarum Trail Extension trail.&nbsp; Follow trail for  2.7 miles to Fullerton Road.&nbsp; Proceed a short distance along Fullerton  Road to the start of the Black Walnut Trail.&nbsp; Reenter the Park and continue  on Black Walnut Trail until you end at Powder Canyon Trail.&nbsp; Turn right  and go 0.2 miles to junction with Purple Sage Trail.&nbsp; Turn left and follow  instructions as in Basic Hike, above.&nbsp; (Blue Line in Google Earth Photo).</p>
<p><strong>d) Alternate Longer Hike (Recommended): </strong>There is a way to navigate the longer hike  (option C) without having to exit and &nbsp;then re-enter the park, which makes  for a more enjoyable experience. As you head East on the Extension Trail, look  for mileage paddle 2.25. A few paces past it you will see a short  single track spur trail on your right. Go up the slight incline and turn left  at the top. Hike down the fire road until it bottoms out. On your right you  will see another single track trail heading West. After about 50-75 yards it  will connect with the beginning of the Black Walnut Trail. As you ascend the  incline you will see the Nogales Trail on your left. Go down Nogales which will  connect you with the southern end of &nbsp;the Powder Canyon Trail. Turn right and follow that  for a short distance and you will come to the Horse Rink area which has benches  and a porta-potty. &nbsp;From the Rink area you have several options available,  including (a) heading North back to the parking lot &amp; trail head or (b)  going up Purple Sage (which will be in direct sun) to continue the 8.5 mile  Option C hike. </p>
