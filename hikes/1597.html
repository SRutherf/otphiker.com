<p><strong>Hike #1597<br>
November 29, 2024<br>
Simi Valley Caves<br>
<br>
Hike Leader:&nbsp;Robert Ferkle</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Meet at 9:00 am for start at 9:30 am<br>
The Rabbits will start at an earlier time to be determined.</strong></p>
	<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>This is an optional fun hike for the day after Thanksgiving. A small contingent of us did this hike almost three years ago. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrPrpsvrZAw">YouTube  video</a>.</strong></font> <br>
  <strong><br>
  Directions to Trailhead:</strong> &nbsp;Go west on the 118 past Rocky Peak Road and  into Simi Valley. Turn right on Kuehner  Drive.&nbsp; Continue 400 yards till the  private gated road and park at either side of the road. The trailhead is on the  south side of the road.</p>
	<p><strong>Facilities:</strong>&nbsp; There are no restrooms or picnic tables at the trailhead, so please bring chairs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Hike 1:&nbsp; Swing Cave</strong><br>
  <br>
  RT Distance, 2.3 miles. Elevation Gain, 995 feet. Mileages are  given from the trailhead.<br>
  <br>
  Download the AllTrails &ldquo;Hummingbird Trail to Swing Cave.&rdquo;  Follow this track to the cave.&nbsp; There  are many cris-crossed trails, so do not deviate from the AllTrails track.<br>
  <br>
  Go south from the trailhead along the edge of the new  housing development. After 0.23 miles take a left turn onto the Hummingbird  Trail. After 70 yards, take the <strong>left fork</strong> at trail marker T-14. Follow  the AllTrails track uphill. After 0.7 miles the trail turns sharply to the  left. Continue upward following the directions painted on the rocks (blue  arrows, white bunnies). After 1.15 miles you will see a steel cable bolted to  the side of the cliff face. Use the  cable to climb around the face of the rock until you see the Swing Cave on your  right. There should be a ladder to assist your final climb into the cave. We  understand that the various swings, hammocks and swinging chairs have been  removed, and the colorful graffiti has been painted over. Too bad. Rest up and  enjoy the view of Simi Valley and the Hummingbird Nest Ranch below. Retrace  your steps to the trailhead. <br>

  <strong>Hike 2:&nbsp; Tunnel Cave</strong><br>
  <br>
  RT Distance, 1.8 miles.&nbsp;  Elevation Gain, 460 feet.<br>
  <br>
  Go south from the trailhead along the edge of the new  housing development. After 0.23 miles take a left turn onto the Hummingbird  Trail. After 70 yards, take the <strong>right fork</strong> at trail marker T-14 and  continue on the Hummingbird Trail.<br>
  <br>
  The Hummingbird Trail splits in two in various places giving  a steep option and a less steep option. The trails rejoin after a short distance.  Follow the trail for approximately 0.9 miles, and look for the Tunnel Cave entrance  on your right. The coordinates are approximately 34.276772 &nbsp;-118.653757. If you have difficulty locating  the entrance to the cave, plug these coordinates into Google Maps to make the  final navigation.<br>
  <br>
  The cave is basically horizontal with a slight downhill  slope and less than 50 yards long. <strong>Use of a head-mounted flashlight is recommended</strong>. Be prepared for  some crawling over rocks and squeezing through narrow spaces. You need to be fairly agile and flexible and  not claustrophobic. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrPrpsvrZAw">YouTube  video</a> to decide whether you want to do this. The cave is  once-through, and you will exit at a different location than you entered. There  is only space for one-directional traffic so do not expect to be able to do a &ldquo;round  trip&rdquo; inside the cave. Retrace your steps to the trailhead.<br>

  <br>
  <strong>Hike 3:&nbsp; Combined Caves</strong><br>
  <br>
  RT Distance, 3.8 miles.&nbsp;  Elevation Gain, 1,455 feet.<br>
  <br>
  A simple combined hike of both caves would involve two  out-and-backs connected at trail marker T-14. Since the Swing Cave climb involves  the greatest elevation change, it would be best to do this first during the  cooler part of the day.<br>
  <br>
  There is a possibility of crossing from the Swing Cave trail  directly to the Tunnel Cave, though there are no well-defined trails and there  is a canyon to traverse, so it could be tricky.<br>
