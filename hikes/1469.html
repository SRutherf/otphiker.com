<p><strong>Directions to  Trailhead:</strong>&nbsp; We will meet at Lowell Brandt Park, 7201 Stephens Ranch Road  in the city of La Verne.&nbsp; From the 210 Freeway take the Fruit Street  offramp and head north for .2 mile, turn left on Baseline Road for .2 mile,  turn right on Esperanza Drive (which becomes Golden Hills Road) for 2.1 miles,  turn right on Stephens Ranch Road then turn left into the first driveway.&nbsp;  Parking is free and restrooms are available.</p>
<p><strong>The Hike:&nbsp;</strong> Walk down to  Golden Hills Road, cross the street and turn left (east).&nbsp; After about a  quarter mile look for an unmarked path on the right (opposite the equestrian  center) that follows the fence line of a gated community. Follow this path  downhill to a junction with the Marshall Canyon Trail.&nbsp; Remember this spot  for your return trip!&nbsp; Here you have two options:</p>
<p><strong>Short Easy Hike</strong> ( 4 miles,  300 feet of elevation).&nbsp; Turn right and head down canyon.&nbsp; You will  find a beautiful shady walk with a few easy stream crossings and rest areas for  lunch.&nbsp; You will pass by a country club with warning signs to keep off the  grass, so stay on the trail at this point.&nbsp; In 2 miles you come out on  residential Orangewood Street where you turn around and return the way you  came.</p>
<p><strong>Longer Moderate Hike</strong> ( 7  miles, 900 feet of elevation).&nbsp; Turn left and head up canyon.&nbsp; You go  through a tunnel underneath Esperanza Drive.&nbsp; There will be multiple  trails and ways to go along the route, but most of them all end up at the same  destination.&nbsp; Follow signs for Marshall Canyon Trail and when in doubt  choose the most traveled path.&nbsp; After about 1.3 miles you reach a signed  junction.&nbsp; Take the left fork to remain on Marshall Canyon Trail; we will  be returning on the right fork.&nbsp; Follow this path up to a picnic spot with  tables which marks the end of Marshall Canyon Trail.&nbsp; Continue along the  road now called Cobal Canyon Motorway.&nbsp; You will pass a signed trail back  to Marshall Canyon and shortly after an unusual rest stop called the Antonovich  De-Duster.&nbsp; You enter Claremont Hills Wilderness Park and come to a  gate.&nbsp; Turn right and continue past another rest stop to an unsigned  junction with the Miller Lateral.&nbsp; Here you make a very sharp right turn  (almost a u-turn) and head back to Marshall Canyon.&nbsp; At this point you  follow the Marshall Canyon Trail back the same way you came.</p>
BYO refreshments  to eat at Lowell Brandt  Park.
