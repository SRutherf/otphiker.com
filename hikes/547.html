<center><h3><b>San Rafael Hills from Cherry Canyon Trail</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 7 miles round trip.<br>
Elevation gain = 700 ft.</p>

<p>Note:  There are no restrooms at the trailhead or at any place on the hike.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead:</p>

<p>From the 2 Freeway north, exit at Verdugo Boulevard, just before the junction with the 210. Do not take Verdugo Road, which is about 8 miles south.  Turn right (east) to Descanso Drive (2 lights).  Turn right to Chevy Chase Drive (first stop sign).  Turn right and very soon (first street) another right onto Hamstead Road.  Follow it about 0.5 miles to the signed right turnoff for Cherry Canyon. The sign is hard to see coming this way, if you get to Flintridge Drive (stop sign) you went too far.</p>

<p>From the 210-freeway exit at Angeles Crest Hwy. <b>south</b>, turn right (south) to Foothill Blvd. Turn right and immediately left onto Chevy Chase Drive. Follow it past the first stop sign to Hamstead Road. Continue as per above.</p>

<p>The Hike:  We take the Cherry Canyon trail almost to the ridge crest and turn left onto the Cerro Negro trail all the way to the lookout tower for our Cookie break. Anyone wanting a longer hike can continue south from there all the way into Glendale (up to 4 to 5 miles one way!).  We take the Flint canyon trail to the Hospital overlook and have lunch there.  We return the same way to Liz's loop trail and return to the trailhead.</p>
