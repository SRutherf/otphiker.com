<center><h3><b>Cold Creek Trail to Calabasas Peak</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 9.6 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain = 750 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: From Pacific Coast Highway, drive north on Topanga Canyon Blvd. One mile <u>before</u> Top of Topanga Overlook, turn left to Summit Valley trailhead and park. From the Valley, drive south on Topanga Canyon Blvd. One mile south of Top of Topanga turn right and park.</p>

<p>The Hike: To connect with the Summit Valley trail, go south from the parking lot to Glenview development.  Go west on Cannon Dr. & south on Alta Drive which turns west and connects to the Summit to Summit Motorway.  Eventually, the motorway turns west continuing on to an intersection with Old Topanga Road.  Cross the road and continue now on the Calabasas Peak Motorway to Calabasas Cold Creek Trail.  We will have lunch and return the same way we went out.</p>

<p>For those who would like to continue on to Calabasas Peak, it's only 0.9 miles longer and 298 ft. elevation gain. Calabasas Peak overlooks everything close by. Only the east west backbone to the south, dominated by Saddle Peak, is higher. The view one mile west is of Stokes Canyon and Stokes Ridge. Beyond is Malibu Creek State Park distinguished by the volcanic Goat Buttes.</p>

<p>Alternate Hike: Hike the Summit to Summit Motorway as far as you wish and return to the trailhead where we will have our refreshments.</p>
