><p>Directions to trailhead: Casper's Wilderness Park is located on the Ortega Highway in Orange County. Turn left (East) on Hwy 74 (Ortega Highway) and drive 7.5 miles to the entrance to the park, which is on the left, just after passing the Tree of Life Nursery. There is a $2.00 day use fee payable to the ranger at the gate. Drive 1.2 miles to
the end of the paved road at the Old Corral Picnic Area. There are ample parking and modern toilet facilities.</p>

<p>The park is in coastal sage scrub country with a seasonal stream, which is usually dry. There are sycamores and coast live oaks in the canyons. There is a lot of wildlife here. Two years ago we saw a badger out in the open on a hike. Mountain lions have already been seen here in 2004, and for this reason we don't want anyone hiking alone.</p>

<p>Short Hike: About 4 miles and 400 foot elevation. Quail Run to East Ridge Trail
(left), turn left on Cougar Pass Trail, and return on Bell Canyon Trail.</p>

<p>Medium Hike: About 5 miles and probably 500 foot gain. Quail Run to East Ridge Trail (left); turn right on Cougar Pass, then left on Oso Trail and return on Bell Canyon Trail.</p>

<p>Long Hike: 7.5 miles and 1500 foot gain. Quail Run to East Ridge Trail (left), turn right on Oso Trail and climb to Badger Pass lookout (picnic table with view). Return on Oso trail to Cougar Pass, then Bell Canyon.</p>

<p>The jackrabbits are free to <i>ad lib</i> and continue on the Oso Trail, or return and take other trails to the West Ridge Trail, but please, no solo hikers.</p>
