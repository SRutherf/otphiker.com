<p>Hike #1236<br>
July 29, 2015<br>
Burkhart Trail, Pleasant View Ridge Wilderness</p>

<p>Steve Babcock, Hike Leader</p>
 
<p>Directions to Trailhead: From the 210 freeway in La Canada take the Angeles Crest Highway off ramp and drive up Highway 2 to Buckhorn Campground about 34 miles. Please <u>do not</u> make the mistake of turning into the Buckhorn day use area which is located about 500 yards <u>before</u> the campground.  Turn left into the campground on a narrow one-way road and follow signs for trailhead parking.  Adventure Pass is required.  There is a restroom located in the parking lot.</p>
 
<p>The Hike:</p>
 
<p><b>Option #1 – 3.6 miles</b> -  From the parking lot (elevation 6450) hike down the Burkhart trail passing a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail to a scenic spot where Little Rock Creek joins the waters of Cooper Canyon (1.8 miles elevation 5600). Return the same way.</p>
 
<p><b>Option #2 – 6 miles</b> - Hike down the Burkhart Trail to a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail (1.5 miles elevation 5740). Turn left, cross the stream and follow the PCT upstream to Cooper Canyon Trail Camp (another 1.5 miles elevation 6300). Here you will find tables to enjoy lunch. Return the same way.</p>
 
<p><b>Option #3 – 6.6 miles</b> - (recommended) – Combine options 1 and 2 by first hiking to Little Rock Creek, turning around and hiking to Cooper Trail Camp for lunch, then back up to Buckhorn parking lot.</p>
 
<p><b>Option #4 – 10 miles</b> – Hike the Burkhart Trail past Little Rock Creek all the way to Burkhart Saddle (5 miles elevation 6950).  Here you will enjoy a nice view of the Mojave desert.  Return the same way.</p>
 
<p>Refreshments will be served in the parking lot. There is only one picnic table, so please bring your own chair.</p>
