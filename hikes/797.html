<center><h3><b>Devil's Canyon/Oat Mountain/Ybarra Canyon - Shuttle</b></h3></center></p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
RT = 7.6 miles<br>
Elevation Gain = 740 ft.

<p>Directions to the Trailhead: Assemble at the parking lot at the Devil’s Canyon trailhead at the north end of Topanga Canyon Blvd. To get there exit the 118 Freeway in Chatsworth at Topanga Canyon. At the bottom of the ramp make a short right turn, then a left turn up the frontage road. Within about 50 feet take a sharp right turn (almost 180 degrees) up a steep paved road (Bella Vista). Look for a sign on the right for the condo leasing office.  Park there.  Observe the parking colors.</p>
 
<p>Once assembled, we will car pool to Coyote Canyon where both hikes begin. Drive east on the 118 Freeway by going under the freeway and turning left up ramp. Exit DeSoto Ave (next off ramp). At base of ramp on DeSoto turn left (north). At the end of DeSoto turn right up Brown’s Canyon Road for 1.2 miles. Pull in and park near the Conservancy sign on the left side of the road.</p>
 
<p>The Hike: Both hikes follow a well established horse trail for 2 miles where the trail turns downhill and ends on Brown’s Canyon Road. At this point hikers go separate ways. </p>
 
<p>Short hikers walk up Brown’s Canyon Road about 50 feet. At the paved road, on the left, step over or go around the chain and start down Ybarra Canyon. (Leader must obtain permission to enter this canyon which is private property. The property sold recently (March 2006) and the new owner is expected to fence it in.  This may be the only opportunity for us to visit this beautiful place.) When the pavement ends beyond the gate, continue down the canyon following the trail and stream where in about 2 miles it joins Devil’s Canyon at a flood control dam. Take a left, down stream, and follow it back to the Devils Canyon trailhead for post hike refreshments.</p>
 
<p>Long hikers walk 0.2 mi. up Brown's Canyon Road to a dirt trail on the left. Disregard the "No Trespassing" sign attached to a gate - this is park property now. Follow this well defined trail down and around to Devil’s Canyon, take a left, down stream, and continue to the Devil’s Canyon trail head and refreshments.</p> 
 
<p>Ride pools will be necessary for shuttle drivers to recover their vehicles.</p>

<p>After the hike we will drive back to Topanga Canyon Blvd., head south, and turn west on Chatsworth to reach the park at its end where we will have our refreshments.</p>
