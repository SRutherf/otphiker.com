<p>GPS Data:<br>

Crystal Lake to Mt. Islip via Windy Gap (return by same route) = 7.8 mi. RT; max. elev. = 2530 ft.<br>

<p>Directions to trailhead: On east I-210, exit Azusa Avenue (Highway 39). Go north through Azusa into San Gabriel Canyon.  After 12 miles one passes the bridge to the East Fork Road.  Continue straight on Highway 39 for 12 more miles.  Turn right into the signed entrance to Crystal Lake Recreation Area.  Drive through the campground. Go ½ mile past the Snack Shop and Visitor Center to where there is a locked gate in front of you and the road forks in several directions.  Park in the large dirt lot on the right.  Rest rooms are scattered throughout the area.</p>

<p>The hike: The trail starts across from the parking area.  The trailhead is signed “Windy Gap - 2.5 mi.” Windy Gap is the low point in the ridge in front of you.  In 0.04 mile you cross a road heading to Deer Flats and South Hawkins.  Continue on the trail and in 0.07 mile more you will again cross the South Hawkins road and continue on the signed trail. In 0.1 mi. one reaches a junction with the Big Cienega Cutoff Trail.  Continue right on the main trail. In about 2.3 miles you will reach Windy Gap Saddle where there is always a cooling breeze.</p>  

<p>At this point there are choices to be made. Call it a hike, and return to the trailhead the way you came. Continue on to Little Jimmy Campground or Mt. Islip or Mt. Hawkins. At Mt. Islip you may either return to Windy Gap, or continue beyond the peak on a marginal trail via Big Cienega, ultimately intersecting the Windy Gap trail at the South Hawkins road.</p>
