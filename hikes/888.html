<p>Trailhead: Rotonda Drive parking lot.</p>

<p>Distance: 7.1 miles.<br>
Elevation: 900 feet with moderate slopes.</p>

<p>View: Trump International Golf Course, Catalina Island, Portuguese Bend, maybe some whales.</p>

<p>Trailhead Directions: South on the Harbor Freeway (110) which ends at Gaffey Street, Left on Gaffey, right on 25th Street, then about 3 miles to Rotonda Drive, on the left. The parking lot is all the way at the end of Rotonda.</p>

<p>There is a restroom at the trailhead.</p>

<p>The Hike: The trail takes us through part of Trump International Golf Course along the bluff overlooking the beach.  We will hike up past the clubhouse (there are public restrooms on the lower level near the golf carts but none after that). Then up Ocean Trails Drive, crossing Palos Verdes Drive S. to Forrestal Dr.</p>

<p>It is about 0.6 mile from the clubhouse to the entrance of the Forrestal Ecological Reserve.  The trails are well marked: Pirate, Mariposa, Flying Mane, Canyon View, and Vista.  This is a nice spot for a break to enjoy the view.  Back track down Vista, then Dauntless, Conqueror, and Purple Sage.</p>

<p>We exit from the reserve and retrace our path back to the parking area (2.6 miles).</p>

<p>People wishing to shorten the hike can return via the sidewalk east along Palos Verdes Drive S. and then down Rotonda Drive to the parking area.</p>
