<center><h3><b>Devil's Canyon from Mileage Paddle 50.50</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance:  About 9 miles<br>
Elevation gain:  2100 feet</p>
<p>Trailhead Directions:  Take Hwy 2 past Red Box to mileage paddle 50.50 and park by the side of the road.  This is about 2 miles beyond Charlton Flat and the south Chilao entrance, but before the main Chilao entrance and visitor center.  There is a rest room at the parking area, and a sign for Devil’s canyon.</p>

<p>The hike:  The trail goes consistently downhill; the first 1.5 miles are switchbacks until we join a tributary of the main stream.  At about 2.6 miles we reach the main stream, and continue on down until the trail becomes impassable.  Shortly before the end of our descent, a small cascade joins the stream from the east.  Return by the same trail.   Most of the trail is in a deep canyon, so is somewhat shaded.</p>

<p>There is no specific alternate hike for those wanting to do a shorter hike.  People wanting to do a shorter walk will simply need to choose when to turn around, remembering that the return is all uphill.  A good place to turn around might be at about 2.6 miles where the tributary stream joins the main one.  This would give a hike of 5.2 miles.</p>

<p>Refreshments in the parking area.</p>
