<p>Distance: 5.5 miles RT<br>
Elevation gain = 800 ft.</p>

<p>Summary: On this hike, we hike two canyons of the Santa Monicas, with a shuttle by car in between.

<p>Directions to the trailhead: Take Pacific Coast Highway west 1.5 miles past Malibu Canyon Road and turn right into the Corral Canyon Loop Trail parking lot. The parking lot is to your right just east of the Malibu Seafood Fresh Fish Market, address 25653 PCH.</p>

<p>Start of Hike: Proceed on the Corral Canyon Loop Trail, a new hand made trail (2.5 mile loop, 400 ft. gain) that crosses Corral Creek on cement pads, then goes along a salt marsh, eventually reaching an unsigned junction where we continue to the right and hike the loop counter clockwise.  Climbing, we reach the divide with Puerco (Pig) Canyon where we should have fine views of Santa Monica Bay and the Ventura County coastline. Continuing to the west, we drop down into Corral Canyon with an easy ramble south back to the trailhead.</p>

<p>Car Shuttle: As various people finish the loop, they are to gather together to fill each available car. Once filled, the car is now to be driven about 0.3 miles west on PCH to Corral Canyon Road.  Turn right at the Union Gas Station and drive up to the first bend in the road where you will see the entrance to Solstice Canyon Park on your left.  Enter, and follow the (new) road a ½ mile or so to the parking lot. Checkout the information kiosk, grab a brochure and especially look up to the east where you can catch a great view of the "Darth Vader House" high up on the ridge.</p> 

<p>Solstice Canyon Loop: (3 miles, 400 ft. gain) Walk past the gate and up the park road to the signed junction with the TRW Trail which leads up to the place where TRW tested space craft magnetometers.  The trail drops south into Solstice Canyon meeting Old Solstice Road where we turn right, continuing up-canyon.  Soon we'll pass the 1865 Matthew Keller house, believed to be the oldest stone house in the Santa Monica Mountains.  After a few more minutes, we will pass through the Fern Grotto, and then onward, ending at the ruins of the Robert's Ranch House which burned in 1982.  The official hike returns to the Solstice Canyon parking lot via Old Solstice Road (bypassing the TRW Trail).</p>

<p> Hike Options:<br>
Bypass the Corral Canyon Loop - go directly to Solstice Canyon Park (subtract 2.5 miles and 400 ft.).<br>
Bypass the TRW Trail - stay on Old Solstice Road up and back (subtract 0.5 mile and 200 ft.).<br>
From Robert's Ranch House, take the Rising Sun Trail which climbs back up to the east ridge and leads you back to the TRW buildings where you may take a paved road back to Old Solstice Road (add 0.4 mile and perhaps 200 ft.).</p>

<p>Note: It is the obvious responsibility of the hike leader to assure that all cars, and all hikers reach the Solstice Canyon Parking lot.</p>
