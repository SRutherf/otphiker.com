<p>GPS Data:: 8.6 mi RT (incl. Eagle Rock)<br>
Max Elevation Gain = 1.690 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Trailhead: </strong>&nbsp; Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park is at 3600 Reseda Blvd. Tarzana, CA 91365. &nbsp; From the 101, get off at Reseda Blvd. and go south for 3.2 mi.&nbsp; You'll pass Ventura Blvd., Braemar Country Club, and some gated-community homes. &nbsp; Reseda Blvd. dead-ends at the park, so it's hard to get lost. &nbsp; Parking is curbside and costs $5.00 close to the turnaround, but you can park further down the street for free.&nbsp; Stop at the stop signs otherwise prepare to be photographed and receiving a $100 fine.&nbsp; There are restrooms at the turn around and potable water where we'll have refreshments.</p>

<p><strong>The Hike:</strong>&nbsp; We will hike 0.2 miles up the dirt road extension of Reseda Blvd. from Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park to Mullholland Dr.&nbsp; Turn right on Mulholland Dr. and continue for 0.25 miles until a fork in the road.&nbsp; Take the left fork that is the start of Fire Road 30 indicated by the direction sign. &nbsp; Pass by the locked yellow gate.</p>

<p>Walk 0.6 miles along Fire Road 30 and look for the sign "Garapito Canyon Trail" on the right.&nbsp; The sign is not on the side of the fire road but some 20 yards into the brush.&nbsp; Fire Road 30 starts out descending, and then starts ascending.&nbsp; The sign is at this change of elevation, so look for the sign at this point.&nbsp; It is not all that big.&nbsp; <a href="../images/1400_description/Garapito_Sign.jpg">Garapito sign</a>.</p>

<p>The Garapito Trailis a very pleasant trail, much like the Musch Trail out of Trippet Ranch Park.&nbsp; The initial 1.1 miles is downhill, is shaded and is very overgrown.&nbsp; The next 1.7 miles is uphill and in partial sun/shade.&nbsp; The trail ends at the East Topanga Fire Road portion of the Backbone Trail in view of Eagle Rock to the right&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Take the 0.5 round trip to Eagle Rock if you want a little extra mileage.&nbsp; Otherwise, turn left on the Backbone trail for a further 0.8 mile hike to Hub Junction.&nbsp; Hub Junction is a good place to eat lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:&nbsp; </strong>Head south along the Backbone Trail and visit Cathedral Peak and Temescal Peak. Return to the Hub.</p>
<p>Return back down Fire Road 30 to the Reseda Trailhead.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3:&nbsp; A</strong>fter&nbsp;returning 1.4 miles down Fire Road 30 and reaching the Garapito trailhead, take the &quot;Bent Arrow Trail&quot; to the right.&nbsp; This is identified on the Google photo below as the &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; trail.&nbsp; After 0.4 miles you will reach Mullholland Dr. Turn left and continue uphill for another 0.6 miles then turn right at the roadsign within view of the Reseda Trailhead.</p>
<p><strong>Option 4:&nbsp;</strong> Consider doing the loop in a clockwise direction: Fire Road 30, Hub, Eagle Rock, Garapeto Trail.</p>

<p>Bring your own refreshments  for after the hike at the Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park trailhead.</p>
