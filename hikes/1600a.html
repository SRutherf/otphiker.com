<p><strong>Description of the Hike:</strong>&nbsp;The hike starts near the famous Bronson Caves, also known in  the movie industry as &quot;The Bat Caves&quot;. Then we head up the Brush  Canyon Trail to an overlook of Los Angeles and a photo opportunity with the  Hollywood sign. We continue on to merge with the Mulholland Trail, which allows  for a nice view of the Griffith Observatory. Finally we join Mount Lee Dr. to  hike up behind the Hollywood sign and 360 degree views of Hollywood Reservoir,  Los Angeles, Burbank, the Verdugo Mountains, and the San Gabriel Mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Hike: </strong> Go past the gate at the north end of Canyon Drive to enter  the Brush Canyon Trail. Near the top of the canyon at 1.25 miles, there is an  overlook with views of Los Angeles and a photo opportunity with the Hollywood  sign. Continue on Brush Canyon Trail and turn left (west) to merge with  Mulholland Trail (Fire Road) towards Mount Lee Drive. Go past the junction with  the Hollyridge Trail coming up from the left. Mulholland Trail ends at the  paved Mount Lee Drive, 2.25 miles from the start, turn right to go uphill.  Along the way at the last hairpin turn is a bronze plaque mounted on a rock  thanking all those who were instrumental in saving Cahuenga Peak from  developers. This is the trailhead for those that want to extend the hike to  Cahuenga Peak. At the end of Mount Lee Drive is the Hollywood sign. </p>
<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>To extend the hike further, you can hike to  Cahuenga Peak. This narrow, rugged trail with dramatic views takes you to the  1820' highest peak in Griffith Park. Return back to the brass plaque on the  rock at the last hairpin turn on Mount Lee Drive, about 0.15 miles. This is  where the Aileen Getty Ridge Trail begins. Follow the Aileen Getty Ridge Trail  for a third of a mile to get to the peak.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Be sure to walk down from the Canyon Dr. trailhead  and explore the Bronson Caves. This can be done either before or after the  hike.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong><br>
  <strong>Hollywood Sign:&nbsp;</strong>Originally built in 1923, the Hollywood sign will soon  celebrate it's century mark. A group of investors, including Los Angeles Times  publisher Harry Chandler, ordered a huge wooden sign built atop Mt. Lee to make  sure that everyone knew about their new real estate development. The sign read:  &quot;HOLLYWOODLAND.&quot; The Beachwood Canyon Development was advertised as  &quot;above the traffic, congestion, smoke, fog and poisonous gas fumes of the  lowlands.&quot; Looking back now, it's hard to believe Angelenos were worried  about pollution in the early 1920s. During it's lifetime, the sign fell 
into irrelevance and severe disrepair, before finally being  recognized as a civic treasure to be restored and protected. On November 11,  1978, the latest restoration of the sign was completed making it the largest  sign in the world. Each letter stands 45 ft tall and the whole sign is 450 ft  long. Besides the sign, 1,640-foot Mt. Lee has another claim to fame: L.A.'s  first television signals were broadcast from the peak in the 1940s.</p>
<p><strong>  Cahuenga Peak:</strong> At 1,820 feet, Cahuenga Peak is the twelfth highest summit  in the Santa Monica Mountains and the highest summit in Griffith Park. Cahuenga  Peak was purchased by Howard Hughes with intentions to marry Ginger Rogers and  build her a home there. She refused his offer and the land remained 
  undeveloped. In 2002, a group of investors set out to build  a 5 luxury estates on the peak. Locals, city leaders and conservationists  raised money to buy the land but could not raise enough money. Eventually the  Trust for Public Land launched its Save Cahuenga Peak campaign. This included 
draping the Hollywood Sign so that it read &quot;SAVE THE  PEAK&quot;.&nbsp; In 2010, they finally had  enough money to purchase the land and donated it to the city of Los Angeles to  become part of Griffith Park. </p>
<p><strong>Bronson Caves: </strong>The caves were originally a quarry, the crushed rock  from the caves used to pave the streets of a growing Hollywood. The many  western and science fiction movies that were shot from the caves included Star  Trek, Mission Impossible, Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and Batman &amp; Robin.</p>
