<p><strong>GPS Data: </strong><br>
  Chilao Picnic Area to Mt.  Hillyer Summit <br>
  Basic Hike is 6.4 miles  RT; max. elev =1,000 ft.&nbsp; <br>
  Alternate Loop RT = 5.7 mi. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Trailhead Directions:</strong>&nbsp; Drive north on SR-2 (Angeles Crest Hwy.) to mileage paddle 50.60.&nbsp; Turn left toward the Chilao Visitor Center.&nbsp; This is about a mile past the Chilao Campground turn-off.&nbsp; Continue straight 0.4  miles, passing the Visitor Center, to the &ldquo;Upper Chilao Picnic Area&rdquo; sign (post  marker 3N21D).&nbsp; Park in the picnic area spaces or neighboring areas.&nbsp; There are  restrooms at the Picnic Area. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>General Description: </strong>&nbsp; Rising to just over 6,200 feet, Mount Hillyer is actually one of the  easier summits to reach in the high country of the San Gabriel Mountains. &nbsp; Beyond its boulder piles and pine forests, the stretched-out summit offers  several sweeping views of nearby peaks and canyons.&nbsp; You can also hike a mile  along the summit to pursue all the views.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Hike:</strong> &nbsp;We walk 0.3 miles further along the road we  arrived, to reach the Silver Moccasin Trail.&nbsp; We start hiking north on the  Silver Moccasin Trail using switchbacks to gain a slope covered with pines and  chaparral.&nbsp; At 1.1 mi. and the edge of Horse Flats Campground we turn left and  follow a path about 0.1 miles to the Mount Hillyer trailhead and a sign  indicating 2 miles to the summit (the summit is actually 1.7 miles away!). &nbsp; Proceed up the trail past clusters of Manzanita, scrub oak and Jeffrey pine to  a complex of very large boulders.&nbsp; The trail breaks out of the forest onto a  firebreak, and before you realize it, you&rsquo;ve reached the 6,215-foot summit.&nbsp; It  is hard to tell when you&rsquo;ve arrived because the highpoint does not distinguish  itself by rising far above the rest of the mountain.&nbsp; Instead, there is a long  ridge running across Mount Hillyer that crowns the long summit. <br>
  <br>
  A side hike of about 0.3 miles  southwest along the summit ridge onto a firebreak yields a better viewpoint, or  you can hike further along the summit ridge (1 mile RT). &nbsp;Return the way you came.<br>
  <strong><br>
  Alternative Loop Return:</strong>&nbsp; If you&nbsp;continue&nbsp;down the road past the summit, the  fire road narrows to a trail which descends steeply down to the paved Horse  Flats Campground turnoff road (distance from the summit 0.5 mi).&nbsp; We now turn  right and follow this road 0.7 mile to where we left the Silver Moccasin Trail. &nbsp; We then retrace our steps 1.1 miles down the Silver Moccasin to our cars.<br>
