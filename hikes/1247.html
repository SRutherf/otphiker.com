<p>Hike #1247<br>
Rustic Canyon/Bay Tree Trail/Fire Road 30<br>
October 14, 2015</p>

<p>Ron Piekunka, Hike Leader</p>

<p>GPS Data:<br>
RT = 7.9 mi. (Basic Hike)<br>
Elevation Gain = 1100 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: The hike will begin at Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park at 3600 Reseda Blvd., Tarzana, CA 91365. Take the 101 north (west), exit at Reseda Blvd. and go south (towards the ocean) for 3.2 miles. You'll cross Ventura Blvd., pass Braemar Country Club, and some high end gated-community houses. Reseda Blvd. continues through a cyclone fence gate followed by a <b>PHOTO ENFORCED STOP SIGN</b> and then dead ends at a turnaround within the park. Parking is curb side and costs $3.00 above the entrance gate, but is free below the gate. Two Andy Gumps are at the turnaround.</p>

<p>The Hike: From the parking area, hike uphill south to Mulhulland Drive (a dirt road) and go east (left) for 0.6 miles. Look for Power Pole #112509M on the left side of the trail. On the right side of the trail just opposite the power pole, you will see an unmarked, but distinct trail on your right dropping down into Rustic Canyon. Proceed south and down along the bottom of Rustic Canyon for 1.0 mile to the rather indistinct intersection of the Bay Tree Trail. Turn to your right and go west on the Bay Tree Trail for 1.2 miles. It will slowly climb the south slope out of Bay Tree Canyon and meet up with the Backbone Trail. Go east (right) on the Backbone Trail for 0.6 miles until you hit Fire Road 30. Go north (right again) on Fire Road 30 past Temescal Peak, Cathedral Peak the Hub Junction and back to Mulholland Drive, then a short jog over to and down the Reseda connector to the trailhead.</p>

<p>An option to extend the hike by 2 miles would be to turn left at Hub Junction and take the Cheney Fire Road to the Garapito Trail connecting to Fire Road 30 instead of just following Fire Road 30 all the way back.</p>

<p>Refreshments served at the trailhead.</p>
