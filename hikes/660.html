<center><h3><b>Winston Ridge to Winston Peak</b></h3></center></p>

<p>Distance: 5 miles to the ridge; 7.5 miles to the peak<br>
Elevation gain to the ridge = 1000 ft.; to the peak = 1500 ft.</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: Drive north on Highway 2 (Angeles Crest Highway) 32.9 miles from the 210 Freeway continuing past the junction at Clear Creek information center to Cloudburst Summit just past Mile Paddle 57.04.   Park in the gravel parking area on the north side of the road where a gated dirt road goes down.  There is no restroom at the parking lot.</p>

<p>The Hike:  We will hike to Winston Ridge first, and then on the way back, those who want a little more exercise can also do Winston Peak.  We start down the Pacific Crest trail from the parking area.   After a mile the trail crosses the dirt road heading down to Cooper Canyon.   We continue on the trail for another half mile, then leave the PCT and head west around bump 6903 on a use trail.  After reaching a saddle below Winston Ridge, the trail improves and we go up to Winston Ridge at 7003 ft.  Return the way we came until reaching the dirt road. There is less distance to the cars by taking the road, but taking the trail is more scenic.</p> 

<p>On the way back when we get to the PCT, those who want to can branch off and go up the ridge to Winston Peak at 7502 ft., a 500 foot very steep climb on not much of a trail from that point.   After reaching the peak we continue down the ridge on the other side until we reach the dirt road, which takes us down to the cars.</p>
