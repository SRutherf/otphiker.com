<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Please print your own hike descriptions and maps.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>Overview: </strong>The hike is a  total of 6.2 miles on fire roads and a final leg up El Prieto  Canyon. It is totally within the Angeles National  Forest just North of Altadena. A map (some copies will be provided), and following  directions are essential. Shorter and longer variations are available.<br>
  <strong><br>
  Directions toTrailhead:</strong> Exit  the 210 freeway on Lincoln Ave. in North/West Pasadena. Proceed North on  Lincoln. There are no restrooms at  the trailhead but you will be passing a McDonalds at 2157 Lincoln Ave. Notice  the Altadena Community Garden and Loma Alta Park at about 1.8 miles from the  freeway (this is where the after hike party will be held). Continue up Lincoln  another block and turn left on Canyon Crest Road. Follow the (very) curvy  Canyon Crest Road to its junction with Rising  Hill Road (just before CC dead  ends). Proceed up Rising Hill.  It will turn to dirt above  address 4630. Park here in the residential area. Be courteous and keep quiet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Hike: </strong>The hike begins  at the yellow gate (1920 ft.),  and proceeds up the fire road .25 miles  to a junction with the road that comes  up from Millard Camp. Go  left (away from Millard), and the road reaches into El Prieto Canyon and  crosses the small stream. About 150 yards past the stream, note, but do not  take, the signed El Prieto Trail that drops into the canyon.<br>
  <br>
  Continue up the  road to the major junction with a road/trail that leads north to Oakwilde (2380  ft.). Stay left at the junction and follow the road (2N66) down for 3.1 miles  until it drops into El Prieto Canyon (1280 ft.). An obvious  sign then directs us 2 miles up the canyon, toward the upper junction with the  fire road.<br>
  <br>
  There are numerous side trails in the  canyon, always stay on the best path near the stream.  After about 1.4 miles of  climbing up the canyon  you will be on a stretch  that is away from the stream.  A sharp bend to the left, just below a stand of cactus will be encountered. The  bend is also a junction with an upward leading trail. Take the upward trail a  couple of hundred yards back to the cars.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Variations: </strong>A shorter hike with  a bit of a loop may be obtained  by starting as above  and turning back at any time. The mini-loop feature is obtained if one  drops into El Prieto Canyon at the sign above the stream crossing. Look for the  oak to find the trail back to the cars.<br>
  <br>
  Rabbits  may add  another mile and a  couple of hundred feet by ignoring the oak and continuing up the canyon trail until the upper fire  road is reached. Then come back down the road to the cars.</p>
<p><strong>Party</strong>: Loma Alta Park  at 3330 Lincoln Ave, Altadena, about 1.9 miles back down the hill. Enter  the park from the South on Palm Street.</p>
