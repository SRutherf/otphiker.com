<p><center><h3><b>#916<br>
Oak Grove Park, (Hahamonga Park) Altadena to Paul Little CG</h3></b><br>
Oakwilde campground is closed.</center></p>

<p>Distance: 5-6 miles round trip.<br>
Elevation gain: 900 feet<br>
(No GPS Data)</p>

<p>Directions to Trailhead: From 210, exit at Oak Grove/Berkshire off ramp. Go East on Berkshire Avenue. Turn Left where it dead-ends into Oak Grove Drive. Turn Right at the first light into the park (Oak Grove Park). After entering the park, take the first left down to the stop sign. Park near the ball field.</p>

<p>The Hike: From the parking lot at the ball field, go thru the yellow gates and then left on the wide dirt path that runs along the perimeter of the Frisbee golf course. Stay on the trail passing the large parking structure for JPL, continue until the trail makes a small right dip and then stay on the trail with the cement berm to your left. You come out at the JPL turnstile. Turn right and go to a hole in the fence (there is a Road Narrows Sign) follow the trail along the river and go under the bridge and cross to the left and climb out to a paved road.</p>

<p>At the large brown sign, keep to the left. You will pass Ranger housing and a bridge and come to a picnic table, a good place to stop for cookies. Continue on to Gould Camp (this is approximately a 5 RT to this point). Further past Gould Camp (appx 1 mile) are waterfalls. The trail continues on to the Paul Little Campground. Return the way you came.</p>

<p>For More Mileage: When you reach the large brown sign, take one of the trails shown on the right with the mileage attached. I did not take these trails but they do offer more mileage. I checked with the ranger station and they said that the Oakwilde CG is closed and would probably never be opened again, so the rabbits might want to try one of these other trails. Return the way you came.</p>

<p>Refreshments at the trailhead.</p>
